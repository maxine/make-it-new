Paris has a grief of its own on some nights in December. If you walked the streets all night with it, you could not make it sleep‘ A drenching blast of snow worn thin swings down the steps of the Métro. It combs your hair out long on your face, and dries its tears with your hands.  Such a piece of its violence blew in through the door with the young woman. She came in from the street and turned the lock, and stood breathing deep and looking a while before her. There was a. yellow bulb left burning beyond in the kitchen, as good as a lemon squeezed out and the sallow drops of it falling. Hush, hush, said the wily step of the snow outside, pac- ing the long hare windows of the room.  The house was cold, and down the length of the table stood the dishes and disorder left over from supper. The warmest things in the place Were the mouse and her young scampering off from the rinds of cheese left there by the dozen people who had eaten. The shy little beasts went scattering and whistling away when Shiloh threw her cap down and walked across the room. Three woodcuts, as wide as posters, waved from the walls in the sharp draughts of air that came and went like the lifting of a fan: one of a man spading in a rich field, another of a muscular archer setting an arrow to his bow, and another of a strong man sowing handfuls of golden grain. The wooden seats that stood against the walls were covered with soiled, woolly hides.  The range stood black and burdened in the corner, piled up with the day's dishes and wigged with long, thick curls of shining grease. Blessèd is the artisan," said the poster in block letters pinned above it on the plaster, "for his is the joy of creation." The sink was clogged with strips of salad and match butts, and Shiloh gathered up the small bouquet of refuse in her fingers. She turned on the water and, as the pan filled, she stared mindlessly ahead at the photograph that hung over the spigot. Whenever Shiloh turned on the water at night to heat it for the dishes, there stood the photo— graph before her of a strong, beautiful woman in a tunic, with her arms stretched out from the picture. Under her was printed: "I would teach the whole world to dance!"  Shiloh waited there at night in the cold with the stalk of fresh water fall-  ing between them, looking a long while at the face of the strong, dead woman. She had not known her alive, but the long, humorous upper lip and the shapely arms were like Sorrel's. She stood quiet, with her wet coat still buttoned over, and looked at the face of Sorrel's dead sister, and the water brimmed up to the edge of the pan and rippled over. I used to believe in it, she thought; in Sorrel, in the old Roman, an old man with great white ropes of hair, standing clean and tall, like his sister, on his hare sandalled feet.  I used to believe in it, she thought as she set a match to the gas. Every- thing all about lay deep and foul in its own dirt. Whenever he spoke, I be- lieved in the action of poetry, and in the door standing wide for anybody at all who might be wanting shelter. But if ever she said: "There are some nights in December or some other times when I can't come back to it," he would roll himself up in his toga and cry to himself for weeks.  HE went upstairs, two at a time, but softly. The rooms above were dark, but from the light on the land— ing she could see there was a woman sitting still on the floor. She was sitting near to the bench where the child must be sleeping. Her head was bowed, as though in sleep, and a part ran up the middle. She had drawn the woven rug around her for warmth, for there were no fires to bring comfort to the night. Shiloh stepped into the dark, chill room, silently around the woman. Strangers, disciples of Sorrel's, often came and went, but this one she had never seen before. She could see the child's face shining on the black, woolly hide that lay beneath its head, and stooped to touch the child's cheek with her fingers. Suddenly the Woman near the open door raised up her fallen head and swung her face around. "Who's there?" she said sharply. Shiloh could see her stiffen and rear against the light. "What are you doing, sitting there? " said Shiloh indolently out of the dark- ness. She felt the child's hands bloodless as snow on the shaggy cover‘ In the dark she took oflf her coat and laid it over the shape of the child who was sleeping there. "I'm here all right," said the woman sharply. "I'm here, but I'll get out pretty God damn quick."  She spoke with an accent, but scarcely, and Shiloh could see against the light the fierce, wild angles of her face. Her evil neck reached out of her clothes, and her viperous tongue turned sharp on Shiloh. "What do you have to he touching that baby for?" she said. "It was me who got it to sleep, it wasn't you."  Shiloh sat down on the floor close to the bench and lit a cigarette in the darkness. She opened her mouth in the cold and breathed the warm smoke over the child's fingers in her palm. The stale weather in the room went icily up and down her spine, and the woman rolled up in the rug on the other side sat shaking.  "You ain't got no reason to come and set in waking it," said the woman. "None of you have no care for it," she said bitterly. "It didn't have no supper before I come along. All of you coming in at any hour it pleases you. They was all dressed up going out to the moving pictures when [ come along."  "Where are you from?" said Shiloh out of the darkness. So many came and went on again that it was of no interest any more.  "I came up third from Marseilles," said the woman's sour voice. "I walked that way from the gare because I didn't have as much as the Métro fare."  "That's one way of getting warm," said Shiloh languidly. She felt the south wind of her own breath blowing on the child's white hands.  "You don't know nothing I been through with!" the woman shouted out in grief. She drew herself into the rug and sat dark and mourning by the door. "You come and go in your sheets and your shawls and live the Way you please!"  "Why did you come here to Sorrel? " said Shiloh in a little while.  "Hell," said the woman, "I knew the old guy in Germany." She threw up her sharp, thin head in anger. The thought of something else had stirred her scalding bile. "To hell with him and his tribe," she said, "if they wasn't in hell already! This place is as like it as anything I ever seen. I tell you, I'm Russian and I beat it through the revolution, but I never hope to see worse than this place," she said.  Her hands came out like scrawny men against the light, and she scratched their hollow spines aloud with her nails.  "That baby there!" she cried out suddenly in fury. "Why don't they put  talcum powder on it like they do on other babies? That's what I asked them. Little thing not more than two years old. I come to the door and they had their glad rags on, dressed up like a lot of Arabs setting off to the moving pictures. Here's your part in the colony, says Sorrel, set where you are and look to the house. As if I Was to wash up their filth after them. I ain't had no supper. I found the baby crying. It's got a bottom sore like a chimpanzee."  HILOH sat smoking with the child's  fingers against her mouth. A  shadow of warmth was stealing now across its flesh.  "Young ones like you," said the Russian woman with venom, "got no ideas in your head but your own look- out! I've known a lot of your sort," she said, "all I want to know. To hell with the old ones, you say. You got no kick coming."  "What were you doing in Marseilles?" said Shiloh after a little.  "Hell," said the woman, "I got stranded." ‘  They sat quiet in the dark, icy room, harking to the child's breath coming and going.  "I ain't used to anything like this," the woman said. "I was ten years with the Baroness von Hoffen," she said, and her bitter voice had turned to sorrow. "We been living all the time on Riverside Drive, and on the Champs- Elysées, and on the Riviera. She's an American, always spending her money on Sorrel's bum rugs and scarves and things."  Her voice went small and grim in her throat as the thoughts came to her.  "She believes in the. artists, eh! She ought to get a night sleeping on the floor! She fell for the artistic life and bought sandals and tunics off him and went around half—naked too. She ain't got no use for the Baron except his money. She shipped me," said the Russian woman in sorrow. "She give me the gate because she thought it was me had give her away. I don't know how she's making out without me," she said after a moment. "She can't do her own hair for a nickel, and it was always me made every stitch for her, copying after models."  "Did you ever know Sorrel's sister? " Shiloh said.  "Whenever we went to the grand hotels," said the Russian woman, "she used to come along. She cried in the Ritz in London at the table because they didn't have no silver plate for her to eat her asparagus from. There was nothing alike between the two," she said. "The sister was always at the brother. You ain't the only one to know them," the Russian woman said.  "I didn't know his sister," said Shiloh. She lit another cigarette and sat back with her legs stretched out in the dark.  "She taught the Baroness to dance," said the Russian woman with her voice turned proud. "They used to dance on the Dutch beaches, jumping up and down. But the Baroness couldn't run so fast, and she'd get left behind her. Hell, the sister'd come into the room in Germany when Sorrel had the colony. Set down a bottle of whiskey and a beefsteak thicker than your arm, and say hell, Sorrel, to hell with your vegetation! Give these poor guys a meal for a change! He'd stand there and cry, her brother, and then she'd start in trying with him and smooth- ing him down. But she'd have some-  one cook her the beefsteak just the same. A good thick one," said the Russian woman eagerly, "running with juice and cooked up with French- frieds. I knew how she liked them. It was me that made them right for her sometimes. She loved Hollandaise sauce like money, and she'd eat it with :1 spoon. She used to like to start off with artichokes," said the Russian woman, "and them hit:r American olives—"  "Listen, ma vieille," said Shiloh. "I'll go down and cook us something for Slipper. It's ten o'clock at night, but that's not such a bad hour."  The Russian woman looked suddenly toward Shiloh.  "Ain't you had nothing to eat neither? " she said.  Shiloh slipped her hand away, softly, slowly, from the embrace of the child's warm fingers.  "I cook something for myself every night after I get home," she said. She saw the Russian woman's head lifted  curiously to watch her step across the room to the lighted door. In the kitchen the water was boiling on the gas.  N a little while, the woman came down the stairs with the rug folded  over her shoulders. She moved cautiously down, without sound, like a spectre in the hall. She was yellow as saffron in the face and her thin hair hung from her starving skull. There was naught but a bone or two of her body left under the hanging clothes.  The woman followed her wherever she went, swaying, like a woman drunk with weariness and sorrow. She helped Shiloh stack the thick, foul dishes and bear them in to the sink.  "Sit down there and warm yourself {It the gas," said Shiloh. Whatever she did, the Russian woman stood by look- ing curiously at her face. The pile of dishes slid down and settled in the soapy water, and Shiloh turned to break the eggs into the pan.  "What is it you have to do all day?" said the woman shyly in a moment.  "Oh, I sell Sorrel's things at the shop," said Shiloh. "That's what gets me home so late."  "Hell," said the Russian woman, "you got a pretty face. Ain't there nothing better you can do?"  Shiloh sliced the few remaining cold potatoes in and watched them browning sweetly in the butter. The other woman stood up from the chair, and her face hung, avid and thirsting, above the steaming pan.  "The Baroness," said the Russian woman softly, "she used to like nothing better than a roasted chicken. When Sorrel's sister would come in, they'd finish one between them in no time at all."  Shiloh slid the eggs off onto a plate, and they carried their supper in, side by side, to the big, bare room. All around in the bleakness could Sorrel's craft be seen: his woodcuts, his tapes- tries, his handmade rugs standing up- right, like dead men, in the corners.  "My God," said the Russian woman, beginning to eat, "I'll get out of here in a hurry! The Baroness'll send me the fare. I know how she is She kicked me out, but that ain't all there is to it. She thought it was me told the Baron about her and Sorrel, but I never gave her away." They sat close together in the cold room, with the food beginning to warm their bodies. "In ten years," said the Russian woman with sorrow, "I never gave them away."  They took the dry cheese apart between them and laid the parings as well, flat on their bread, and chewed side by side,  "When I joined," said Shiloh slowly as she ate, "we were going to work the hand press." She looked around the room at the disorder, and grinned at the Russian woman. "‘Ve were going to print poetry, and revive the drama," she said. "But nothing ever came of it. Sorrel got some money and bought a new car instead."  "What's keeping you from clearing out?" said the Russian woman. Shiloh wiped her plate clean leisurely with a crust of bread, and then she shrugged her shoulders.  "One thing and another," she said.  "My God," said the Russian woman, "I'll write to the Baroness tomorrow. She won't get anyone to be like I was with the children. Sorrel used to give her the hell," she said bitterly, "about mother- loving your own."  "Yes," said Shiloh. She felt the woman fixed small and terrible in grief beside her.  After a little while the Russian woman said: "Don't the mother of that baby upstairs ever come here and see it?"  "Yes," said Shiloh slowly, "she comes sometimes."  "Ain't she got no money or what?" said the Russian woman.  "No," said Shiloh. She saw her own hand playing slowly with the crumbs left on the table. "She hasn't any money," said Shiloh, "and its father's dead."

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.  "Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."  He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought--frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon--for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.  And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction--Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the "creative temperament"--it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No--Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.   My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.  I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him--with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe--so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, "Why--ye-es" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.  The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.  It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.  "How do you get to West Egg village?" he asked helplessly.  I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.  And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees--just as things grow in fast movies--I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.  There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college--one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the "Yale News"--and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the "well-rounded man." This isn't just an epigram--life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.  It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals--like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end--but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.  I lived at West Egg, the--well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard--it was a factual imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion. Or rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.  Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.  Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven--a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously wealthy--even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach--but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.  Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight into Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.  And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.  He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.  His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked--and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.  "Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final," he seemed to say, "just because I'm stronger and more of a man than you are." We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.  We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.  "I've got a nice place here," he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.  Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.  "It belonged to Demaine the oil man." He turned me around again, politely and abruptly. "We'll go inside."  We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling--and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.  The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.  The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it--indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.  The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression--then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room.  "I'm p-paralyzed with happiness."  She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I've heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)  At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.  I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth--but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered "Listen," a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.  I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.  "Do they miss me?" she cried ecstatically.  "The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the North Shore."  "How gorgeous! Let's go back, Tom. Tomorrow!" Then she added irrelevantly, "You ought to see the baby."  "I'd like to."  "She's asleep. She's two years old. Haven't you ever seen her?"  "Never."  "Well, you ought to see her. She's----"  Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.  "What you doing, Nick?"  "I'm a bond man."  "Who with?"  I told him.  "Never heard of them," he remarked decisively.  This annoyed me.  "You will," I answered shortly. "You will if you stay in the East."  "Oh, I'll stay in the East, don't you worry," he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. "I'd be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else."  At this point Miss Baker said "Absolutely!" with such suddenness that I started--it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.  "I'm stiff," she complained, "I've been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember."  "Don't look at me," Daisy retorted. "I've been trying to get you to New York all afternoon."  "No, thanks," said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, "I'm absolutely in training."  Her host looked at her incredulously.  "You are!" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass. "How you ever get anything done is beyond me."  I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she "got done." I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.  "You live in West Egg," she remarked contemptuously. "I know somebody there."  "I don't know a single----"  "You must know Gatsby."  "Gatsby?" demanded Daisy. "What Gatsby?"  Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.  Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.  "Why CANDLES?" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her fingers. "In two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year." She looked at us all radiantly. "Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it."  "We ought to plan something," yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed.  "All right," said Daisy. "What'll we plan?" She turned to me helplessly. "What do people plan?"  Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger.  "Look!" she complained. "I hurt it."  We all looked--the knuckle was black and blue.  "You did it, Tom," she said accusingly. "I know you didn't mean to but you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of a----"  "I hate that word hulking," objected Tom crossly, "even in kidding."  "Hulking," insisted Daisy.  Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were here--and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself.  "You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy," I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. "Can't you talk about crops or something?"  I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way.  "Civilization's going to pieces," broke out Tom violently. "I've gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read 'The Rise of the Coloured Empires' by this man Goddard?"  "Why, no," I answered, rather surprised by his tone.  "Well, it's a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be--will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved."  "Tom's getting very profound," said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness. "He reads deep books with long words in them. What was that word we----"  "Well, these books are all scientific," insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently. "This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things."  "We've got to beat them down," whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.  "You ought to live in California--" began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.  "This idea is that we're Nordics. I am, and you are and you are and----" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again. "--and we've produced all the things that go to make civilization--oh, science and art and all that. Do you see?"  There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.  "I'll tell you a family secret," she whispered enthusiastically. "It's about the butler's nose. Do you want to hear about the butler's nose?"  "That's why I came over tonight."  "Well, he wasn't always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose----"  "Things went from bad to worse," suggested Miss Baker.  "Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position."  For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened--then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.  The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom's ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing.  "I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a--of a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn't he?" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation. "An absolute rose?"  This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house.  Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said "Sh!" in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.  "This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor----" I said.  "Don't talk. I want to hear what happens."  "Is something happening?" I inquired innocently.  "You mean to say you don't know?" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised. "I thought everybody knew."  "I don't."  "Why----" she said hesitantly, "Tom's got some woman in New York."  "Got some woman?" I repeated blankly.  Miss Baker nodded.  "She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time. Don't you think?"  Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.  "It couldn't be helped!" cried Daisy with tense gayety.  She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: "I looked outdoors for a minute and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He's singing away----" her voice sang "----It's romantic, isn't it, Tom?"  "Very romantic," he said, and then miserably to me: "If it's light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables."  The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing--my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.  The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.  Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.  "We don't know each other very well, Nick," she said suddenly. "Even if we are cousins. You didn't come to my wedding."  "I wasn't back from the war."  "That's true." She hesitated. "Well, I've had a very bad time, Nick, and I'm pretty cynical about everything."  Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.  "I suppose she talks, and--eats, and everything."  "Oh, yes." She looked at me absently. "Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?"  "Very much."  "It'll show you how I've gotten to feel about--things. Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept. 'All right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool--that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool."  "You see I think everything's terrible anyhow," she went on in a convinced way. "Everybody thinks so--the most advanced people. And I KNOW. I've been everywhere and seen everything and done everything." Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with thrilling scorn. "Sophisticated--God, I'm sophisticated!"  The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged.   Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the "Saturday Evening Post"--the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.  When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.  "To be continued," she said, tossing the magazine on the table, "in our very next issue."  Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up.  "Ten o'clock," she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling. "Time for this good girl to go to bed."  "Jordan's going to play in the tournament tomorrow," explained Daisy, "over at Westchester."  "Oh,--you're JORdan Baker."  I knew now why her face was familiar--its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago.  "Good night," she said softly. "Wake me at eight, won't you."  "If you'll get up."  "I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon."  "Of course you will," confirmed Daisy. "In fact I think I'll arrange a marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I'll sort of--oh--fling you together. You know--lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing----"  "Good night," called Miss Baker from the stairs. "I haven't heard a word."  "She's a nice girl," said Tom after a moment. "They oughtn't to let her run around the country this way."  "Who oughtn't to?" inquired Daisy coldly.  "Her family."  "Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick's going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be very good for her."  Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.  "Is she from New York?" I asked quickly.  "From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our beautiful white----"  "Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?" demanded Tom suddenly.  "Did I?" She looked at me. "I can't seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did. It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know----"  "Don't believe everything you hear, Nick," he advised me.  I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called "Wait!  "I forgot to ask you something, and it's important. We heard you were engaged to a girl out West."  "That's right," corroborated Tom kindly. "We heard that you were engaged."  "It's libel. I'm too poor."  "But we heard it," insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way. "We heard it from three people so it must be true."  Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come east. You can't stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage.  Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich--nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms--but apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he "had some woman in New York" was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.  Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone--fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.  I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I didn't call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone--he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced seaward--and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.         About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes--a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight.  But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic--their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.  The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan's mistress.  The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet her--but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car.  "We're getting off!" he insisted. "I want you to meet my girl."  I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence. The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do.  I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage--Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold--and I followed Tom inside.  The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.  "Hello, Wilson, old man," said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder. "How's business?"  "I can't complain," answered Wilson unconvincingly. "When are you going to sell me that car?"  "Next week; I've got my man working on it now."  "Works pretty slow, don't he?"  "No, he doesn't," said Tom coldly. "And if you feel that way about it, maybe I'd better sell it somewhere else after all."  "I don't mean that," explained Wilson quickly. "I just meant----"  His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering. She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:  "Get some chairs, why don't you, so somebody can sit down."  "Oh, sure," agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity--except his wife, who moved close to Tom.  "I want to see you," said Tom intently. "Get on the next train."  "All right."  "I'll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level."  She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.  We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.  "Terrible place, isn't it," said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.  "Awful."  "It does her good to get away."  "Doesn't her husband object?"  "Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York. He's so dumb he doesn't know he's alive."  So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York--or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train.  She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand she bought a copy of "Town Tattle" and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass.  "I want to get one of those dogs," she said earnestly. "I want to get one for the apartment. They're nice to have--a dog."  We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.  "What kind are they?" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the taxi-window.  "All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?"  "I'd like to get one of those police dogs; I don't suppose you got that kind?"  The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.  "That's no police dog," said Tom.  "No, it's not exactly a polICE dog," said the man with disappointment in his voice. "It's more of an airedale." He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. "Look at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog that'll never bother you with catching cold."  "I think it's cute," said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. "How much is it?"  "That dog?" He looked at it admiringly. "That dog will cost you ten dollars."  The airedale--undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly white--changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson's lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.  "Is it a boy or a girl?" she asked delicately.  "That dog? That dog's a boy."  "It's a bitch," said Tom decisively. "Here's your money. Go and buy ten more dogs with it."  We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner.  "Hold on," I said, "I have to leave you here."  "No, you don't," interposed Tom quickly. "Myrtle'll be hurt if you don't come up to the apartment. Won't you, Myrtle?"  "Come on," she urged. "I'll telephone my sister Catherine. She's said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know."  "Well, I'd like to, but----"  We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses. Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in.  "I'm going to have the McKees come up," she announced as we rose in the elevator. "And of course I got to call up my sister, too."  The apartment was on the top floor--a small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom and a bath. The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of "Town Tattle "lay on the table together with a copy of "Simon Called Peter" and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuits--one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.  I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight o'clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom's lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner. When I came back they had disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read a Called Peter"--either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it didn't make any sense to me.  Just as Tom and Myrtle--after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names--reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.  The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.  Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the "artistic game" and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson's mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His wife was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.  Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.  "My dear," she told her sister in a high mincing shout, "most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill you'd of thought she had my appendicitus out."  "What was the name of the woman?" asked Mrs. McKee.  "Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people's feet in their own homes."  "I like your dress," remarked Mrs. McKee, "I think it's adorable."  Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.  "It's just a crazy old thing," she said. "I just slip it on sometimes when I don't care what I look like."  "But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean," pursued Mrs. McKee. "If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it."  We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.  "I should change the light," he said after a moment. "I'd like to bring out the modelling of the features. And I'd try to get hold of all the back hair."  "I wouldn't think of changing the light," cried Mrs. McKee. "I think it's----"  Her husband said "SH!" and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.  "You McKees have something to drink," he said. "Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep."  "I told that boy about the ice." Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. "These people! You have to keep after them all the time."  She looked at me and laughed pointlessly. Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.  "I've done some nice things out on Long Island," asserted Mr. McKee.  Tom looked at him blankly.  "Two of them we have framed downstairs."  "Two what?" demanded Tom.  "Two studies. One of them I call 'Montauk Point--the Gulls,' and the other I call 'Montauk Point--the Sea.' "  The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.  "Do you live down on Long Island, too?" she inquired.  "I live at West Egg."  "Really? I was down there at a party about a month ago. At a man named Gatsby's. Do you know him?"  "I live next door to him."  "Well, they say he's a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. That's where all his money comes from."  "Really?"  She nodded.  "I'm scared of him. I'd hate to have him get anything on me."  This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee's pointing suddenly at Catherine:  "Chester, I think you could do something with HER," she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to Tom.  "I'd like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry. All I ask is that they should give me a start."  "Ask Myrtle," said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray. "She'll give you a letter of introduction, won't you, Myrtle?"  "Do what?" she asked, startled.  "You'll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him." His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented. " 'George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,' or something like that."   Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: "Neither of them can stand the person they're married to."  "Can't they?"  "Can't STAND them." She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom. "What I say is, why go on living with them if they can't stand them? If I was them I'd get a divorce and get married to each other right away."  "Doesn't she like Wilson either?"  The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene.  "You see?" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her voice again. "It's really his wife that's keeping them apart. She's a Catholic and they don't believe in divorce."  Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie.  "When they do get married," continued Catherine, "they're going west to live for a while until it blows over."  "It'd be more discreet to go to Europe."  "Oh, do you like Europe?" she exclaimed surprisingly. "I just got back from Monte Carlo."  "Really."  "Just last year. I went over there with another girl."  "Stay long?"  "No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back. We went by way of Marseilles. We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms. We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you. God, how I hated that town!"  The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean--then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.  "I almost made a mistake, too," she declared vigorously. "I almost married a little kyke who'd been after me for years. I knew he was below me. Everybody kept saying to me: 'Lucille, that man's way below you!' But if I hadn't met Chester, he'd of got me sure."  "Yes, but listen," said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, "at least you didn't marry him."  "I know I didn't."  "Well, I married him," said Myrtle, ambiguously. "And that's the difference between your case and mine."  "Why did you, Myrtle?" demanded Catherine. "Nobody forced you to."  Myrtle considered.  "I married him because I thought he was a gentleman," she said finally. "I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn't fit to lick my shoe."  "You were crazy about him for a while," said Catherine.  "Crazy about him!" cried Myrtle incredulously. "Who said I was crazy about him? I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there."  She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past.  "The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew right away I made a mistake. He borrowed somebody's best suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out. She looked around to see who was listening: " 'Oh, is that your suit?' I said. 'This is the first I ever heard about it.' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon."  "She really ought to get away from him," resumed Catherine to me. "They've been living over that garage for eleven years. And Tom's the first sweetie she ever had."  The bottle of whiskey--a second one--was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who "felt just as good on nothing at all." Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves. I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.  Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.  "It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and I couldn't keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head. When we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm--and so I told him I'd have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting into a subway train. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was 'You can't live forever, you can't live forever.' "  She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter.  "My dear," she cried, "I'm going to give you this dress as soon as I'm through with it. I've got to get another one tomorrow. I'm going to make a list of all the things I've got to get. A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother's grave that'll last all summer. I got to write down a list so I won't forget all the things I got to do."  It was nine o'clock--almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.  The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy's name.  "Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!" shouted Mrs. Wilson. "I'll say it whenever I want to! Daisy! Dai----"  Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.  Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene--his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of "Town Tattle" over the tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier I followed.  "Come to lunch some day," he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.  "Where?"  "Anywhere."  "Keep your hands off the lever," snapped the elevator boy.  "I beg your pardon," said Mr. McKee with dignity, "I didn't know I was touching it."  "All right," I agreed, "I'll be glad to."  . . . I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.  "Beauty and the Beast . . . Loneliness . . . Old Grocery Horse . . . Brook'n Bridge . . . ."  Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning "Tribune" and waiting for the four o'clock train.         There was music from my neighbor's house through the summer nights. In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars. At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.  Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York--every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler's thumb.  At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another.  By seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived--no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums. The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.  The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath--already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.  Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform. A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray's understudy from the "Follies." The party has begun.  I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby's house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited. People were not invited--they went there. They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door. Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks. Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.  I had been actually invited. A chauffeur in a uniform of robin's egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer--the honor would be entirely Gatsby's, it said, if I would attend his "little party" that night. He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it--signed Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand.  Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn't know--though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train. I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans. I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles. They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.  As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table--the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone.  I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden.  Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by.  "Hello!" I roared, advancing toward her. My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden.  "I thought you might be here," she responded absently as I came up. "I remembered you lived next door to----"  She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she'd take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps.  "Hello!" they cried together. "Sorry you didn't win."  That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals the week before.  "You don't know who we are," said one of the girls in yellow, "but we met you here about a month ago."  "You've dyed your hair since then," remarked Jordan, and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's basket. With Jordan's slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble.  "Do you come to these parties often?" inquired Jordan of the girl beside her.  "The last one was the one I met you at," answered the girl, in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion: "Wasn't it for you, Lucille?"  It was for Lucille, too.  "I like to come," Lucille said. "I never care what I do, so I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address--inside of a week I got a package from Croirier's with a new evening gown in it."  "Did you keep it?" asked Jordan.  "Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars."  "There's something funny about a fellow that'll do a thing like that," said the other girl eagerly. "He doesn't want any trouble with ANYbody."  "Who doesn't?" I inquired.  "Gatsby. Somebody told me----"  The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.  "Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once."  A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly.  "I don't think it's so much THAT," argued Lucille skeptically; "it's more that he was a German spy during the war."  One of the men nodded in confirmation.  "I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany," he assured us positively.  "Oh, no," said the first girl, "it couldn't be that, because he was in the American army during the war." As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. "You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody's looking at him. I'll bet he killed a man."  She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world.  The first supper--there would be another one after midnight--was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden. There were three married couples and Jordan's escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside--East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.  "Let's get out," whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour. "This is much too polite for me."  We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host--I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.  The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there. She couldn't find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn't on the veranda. On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas.  A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books. As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot.  "What do you think?" he demanded impetuously.  "About what?"  He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.  "About that. As a matter of fact you needn't bother to ascertain. I ascertained. They're real."  "The books?"  He nodded.  "Absolutely real--have pages and everything. I thought they'd be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they're absolutely real. Pages and--Here! Lemme show you."  Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the "Stoddard Lectures."  "See!" he cried triumphantly. "It's a bona fide piece of printed matter. It fooled me. This fella's a regular Belasco. It's a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew when to stop too--didn't cut the pages. But what do you want? What do you expect?"  He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.  "Who brought you?" he demanded. "Or did you just come? I was brought. Most people were brought."  Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.  "I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt," he continued. "Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere last night. I've been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library."  "Has it?"  "A little bit, I think. I can't tell yet. I've only been here an hour. Did I tell you about the books? They're real. They're----"  "You told us."  We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.  There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the corners--and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing "stunts" all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage "twins"--who turned out to be the girls in yellow--did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.  I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter. I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound.  At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled.  "Your face is familiar," he said, politely. "Weren't you in the Third Division during the war?"  "Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion."  "I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen. I knew I'd seen you somewhere before."  We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning.  "Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along the Sound."  "What time?"  "Any time that suits you best."  It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled.  "Having a gay time now?" she inquired.  "Much better." I turned again to my new acquaintance. "This is an unusual party for me. I haven't even seen the host. I live over there----" I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, "and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation."  For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.  "I'm Gatsby," he said suddenly.  "What!" I exclaimed. "Oh, I beg your pardon."  "I thought you knew, old sport. I'm afraid I'm not a very good host."  He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished--and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced himself I'd got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care.  Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn.  "If you want anything just ask for it, old sport," he urged me. "Excuse me. I will rejoin you later."  When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan--constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years.  "Who is he?" I demanded. "Do you know?"  "He's just a man named Gatsby."  "Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?"  "Now YOU're started on the subject," she answered with a wan smile. "Well,--he told me once he was an Oxford man."  A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away.  "However, I don't believe it."  "Why not?"  "I don't know," she insisted, "I just don't think he went there."  Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl's "I think he killed a man," and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible. But young men didn't--at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn't--drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.  "Anyhow he gives large parties," said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. "And I like large parties. They're so intimate. At small parties there isn't any privacy."  There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.  "Ladies and gentlemen," he cried. "At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff's latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation." He smiled with jovial condescension and added "Some sensation!" whereupon everybody laughed.  "The piece is known," he concluded lustily, "as 'Vladimir Tostoff's Jazz History of the World.' "  The nature of Mr. Tostoff's composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the "Jazz History of the World" was over girls were putting their heads on men's shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men's arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls--but no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby's shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby's head for one link.  "I beg your pardon."  Gatsby's butler was suddenly standing beside us.  "Miss Baker?" he inquired. "I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone."  "With me?" she exclaimed in surprise.  "Yes, madame."  She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes--there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.  I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan's undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside.  The large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad--she was not only singing, she was weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks--not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.  "She had a fight with a man who says he's her husband," explained a girl at my elbow.  I looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan's party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks--at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed "You promised!" into his ear.  The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.  "Whenever he sees I'm having a good time he wants to go home."  "Never heard anything so selfish in my life."  "We're always the first ones to leave."  "So are we."  "Well, we're almost the last tonight," said one of the men sheepishly. "The orchestra left half an hour ago."  In spite of the wives' agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.  As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.  Jordan's party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.  "I've just heard the most amazing thing," she whispered. "How long were we in there?"  "Why,--about an hour."  "It was--simply amazing," she repeated abstractedly. "But I swore I wouldn't tell it and here I am tantalizing you." She yawned gracefully in my face. "Please come and see me. . . . Phone book. . . . Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard. . . . My aunt. . . ." She was hurrying off as she talked--her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door.  Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby's guests who were clustered around him. I wanted to explain that I'd hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.  "Don't mention it," he enjoined me eagerly. "Don't give it another thought, old sport." The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder. "And don't forget we're going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."  Then the butler, behind his shoulder:  "Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir."  "All right, in a minute. Tell them I'll be right there. . . . good night."  "Good night."  "Good night." He smiled--and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time. "Good night, old sport. . . . Good night."  But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby's drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.  A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.  "See!" he explained. "It went in the ditch."  The fact was infinitely astonishing to him--and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man--it was the late patron of Gatsby's library.  "How'd it happen?"  He shrugged his shoulders.  "I know nothing whatever about mechanics," he said decisively.  "But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?"  "Don't ask me," said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter. "I know very little about driving--next to nothing. It happened, and that's all I know."  "Well, if you're a poor driver you oughtn't to try driving at night."  "But I wasn't even trying," he explained indignantly, "I wasn't even trying."  An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.  "Do you want to commit suicide?"  "You're lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even TRYing!"  "You don't understand," explained the criminal. "I wasn't driving. There's another man in the car."  The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained "Ah-h-h!" as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd--it was now a crowd--stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.  Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster.  "Wha's matter?" he inquired calmly. "Did we run outa gas?"  "Look!"  Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel--he stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.  "It came off," some one explained.  He nodded.  "At first I din' notice we'd stopped."  A pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice:  "Wonder'ff tell me where there's a gas'line station?"  At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond.  "Back out," he suggested after a moment. "Put her in reverse."  "But the WHEEL'S off!"  He hesitated.  "No harm in trying," he said.  The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby's house, making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.   Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.  Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.  I took dinner usually at the Yale Club--for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day--and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.  I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner--young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life.  Again at eight o'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside. Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well.  For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name. Then it was something more. I wasn't actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something--most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don't in the beginning--and one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it--and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy's. At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers--a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round. The thing approached the proportions of a scandal--then died away. A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.  Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest. She wasn't able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body.  It made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply--I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man's coat.  "You're a rotten driver," I protested. "Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn't to drive at all."  "I am careful."  "No, you're not."  "Well, other people are," she said lightly.  "What's that got to do with it?"  "They'll keep out of my way," she insisted. "It takes two to make an accident."  "Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself."  "I hope I never will," she answered. "I hate careless people. That's why I like you."  Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home. I'd been writing letters once a week and signing them: "Love, Nick," and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.  Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.         On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby's house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.  "He's a bootlegger," said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers. "One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil. Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass."  Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsby's house that summer. It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds and headed "This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922." But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby's hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him.  From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie's wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.  Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett's automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Beluga's girls.  From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. ("Rot-Gut") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly--they came to gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day.  A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as "the boarder"--I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O'Donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.  Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have forgotten their names--Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be.  In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O'Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.  All these people came to Gatsby's house in the summer.   At nine o'clock, one morning late in July Gatsby's gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn. It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach.  "Good morning, old sport. You're having lunch with me today and I thought we'd ride up together."  He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American--that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.  He saw me looking with admiration at his car.  "It's pretty, isn't it, old sport." He jumped off to give me a better view. "Haven't you ever seen it before?"  I'd seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town.  I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door.  And then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn't reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit.  "Look here, old sport," he broke out surprisingly. "What's your opinion of me, anyhow?"  A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves.  "Well, I'm going to tell you something about my life," he interrupted. "I don't want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear."  So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls.  "I'll tell you God's truth." His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by. "I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west--all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years. It is a family tradition."  He looked at me sideways--and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying. He hurried the phrase "educated at Oxford," or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before. And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn't something a little sinister about him after all.  "What part of the middle-west?" I inquired casually.  "San Francisco."  "I see."  "My family all died and I came into a good deal of money."  His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.  "After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe--Paris, Venice, Rome--collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago."  With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned "character" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.  "Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn't advance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead. I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decoration--even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!"  Little Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them--with his smile. The smile comprehended Montenegro's troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro's warm little heart. My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines.  He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm.  "That's the one from Montenegro."  To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look.  _Orderi di Danilo_, ran the circular legend, _Montenegro, Nicolas Rex_.  "Turn it."  _Major Jay Gatsby_, I read, _For Valour Extraordinary_.  "Here's another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It was taken in Trinity Quad--the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster."  It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger--with a cricket bat in his hand.  Then it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.  "I'm going to make a big request of you today," he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, "so I thought you ought to know something about me. I didn't want you to think I was just some nobody. You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me." He hesitated. "You'll hear about it this afternoon."  "At lunch?"  "No, this afternoon. I happened to find out that you're taking Miss Baker to tea."  "Do you mean you're in love with Miss Baker?"  "No, old sport, I'm not. But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter."  I hadn't the faintest idea what "this matter" was, but I was more annoyed than interested. I hadn't asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby. I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry I'd ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.  He wouldn't say another word. His correctness grew on him as we neared the city. We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds. Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by.  With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria--only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar "jug--jug--SPAT!" of a motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside.  "All right, old sport," called Gatsby. We slowed down. Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the man's eyes.  "Right you are," agreed the policeman, tipping his cap. "Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse ME!"  "What was that?" I inquired.  "The picture of Oxford?"  "I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year."  Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money. The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.  A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends. The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby's splendid car was included in their somber holiday. As we crossed Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.  "Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought; "anything at all. . . ."  Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.   Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby for lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.  "Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem."  A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness.  "--so I took one look at him--" said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, "--and what do you think I did?"  "What?" I inquired politely.  But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose.  "I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid, 'All right, Katspaugh, don't pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.' He shut it then and there."  Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.  "Highballs?" asked the head waiter.  "This is a nice restaurant here," said Mr. Wolfshiem looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. "But I like across the street better!"  "Yes, highballs," agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: "It's too hot over there."  "Hot and small--yes," said Mr. Wolfshiem, "but full of memories."  "What place is that?" I asked.  "The old Metropole.  "The old Metropole," brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. "Filled with faces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can't forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. 'All right,' says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair.  " 'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don't you, so help me, move outside this room.'  "It was four o'clock in the morning then, and if we'd of raised the blinds we'd of seen daylight."  "Did he go?" I asked innocently.  "Sure he went,"--Mr. Wolfshiem's nose flashed at me indignantly--"He turned around in the door and says, 'Don't let that waiter take away my coffee!' Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away."  "Four of them were electrocuted," I said, remembering.  "Five with Becker." His nostrils turned to me in an interested way. "I understand you're looking for a business gonnegtion."  The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered for me:  "Oh, no," he exclaimed, "this isn't the man!"  "No?" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.  "This is just a friend. I told you we'd talk about that some other time."  "I beg your pardon," said Mr. Wolfshiem, "I had a wrong man."  A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room--he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.  "Look here, old sport," said Gatsby, leaning toward me, "I'm afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car."  There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.  "I don't like mysteries," I answered. "And I don't understand why you won't come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?"  "Oh, it's nothing underhand," he assured me. "Miss Baker's a great sportswoman, you know, and she'd never do anything that wasn't all right."  Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.  "He has to telephone," said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes. "Fine fellow, isn't he? Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman."  "Yes."  "He's an Oggsford man."  "Oh!"  "He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?"  "I've heard of it."  "It's one of the most famous colleges in the world."  "Have you known Gatsby for a long time?" I inquired.  "Several years," he answered in a gratified way. "I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to myself: 'There's the kind of man you'd like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.' " He paused. "I see you're looking at my cuff buttons."  I hadn't been looking at them, but I did now.  They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory.  "Finest specimens of human molars," he informed me.  "Well!" I inspected them. "That's a very interesting idea."  "Yeah." He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. "Yeah, Gatsby's very careful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend's wife."  When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.  "I have enjoyed my lunch," he said, "and I'm going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome."  "Don't hurry, Meyer," said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction.  "You're very polite but I belong to another generation," he announced solemnly. "You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your----" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand--"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won't impose myself on you any longer."  As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I wondered if I had said anything to offend him.  "He becomes very sentimental sometimes," explained Gatsby. "This is one of his sentimental days. He's quite a character around New York--a denizen of Broadway."  "Who is he anyhow--an actor?"  "No."  "A dentist?"  "Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he's a gambler." Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: "He's the man who fixed the World's Series back in 1919."  "Fixed the World's Series?" I repeated.  The idea staggered me. I remembered of course that the World's Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain. It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.  "How did he happen to do that?" I asked after a minute.  "He just saw the opportunity."  "Why isn't he in jail?"  "They can't get him, old sport. He's a smart man."  I insisted on paying the check. As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room.  "Come along with me for a minute," I said. "I've got to say hello to someone."  When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.  "Where've you been?" he demanded eagerly. "Daisy's furious because you haven't called up."  "This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan."  They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby's face.  "How've you been, anyhow?" demanded Tom of me. "How'd you happen to come up this far to eat?"  "I've been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby."  I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there.   One October day in nineteen-seventeen---- (said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel) --I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way.  The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, "anyways, for an hour!"  When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until I was five feet away.  "Hello Jordan," she called unexpectedly. "Please come here."  I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the same man.  That was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn't see Daisy very often. She went with a slightly older crowd--when she went with anyone at all. Wild rumors were circulating about her--how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. After that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't get into the army at all.  By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  I was bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.  " 'Gratulate me," she muttered. "Never had a drink before but oh, how I do enjoy it."  "What's the matter, Daisy?"  I was scared, I can tell you; I'd never seen a girl like that before.  "Here, dearis." She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. "Take 'em downstairs and give 'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell 'em all Daisy's change' her mine. Say 'Daisy's change' her mine!'."  She began to cry--she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her mother's maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath. She wouldn't let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.  But she didn't say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o'clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months' trip to the South Seas.  I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a minute she'd look around uneasily and say "Where's Tom gone?" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together--it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was broken--she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.  The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year. I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation. Perhaps because she doesn't drink. It's a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don't see or care. Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all--and yet there's something in that voice of hers. . . .  Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years. It was when I asked you--do you remember?--if you knew Gatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said "What Gatsby?" and when I described him--I was half asleep--she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know. It wasn't until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car.   When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:       "I'm the Sheik of Araby,     Your love belongs to me.     At night when you're asleep,     Into your tent I'll creep----"   "It was a strange coincidence," I said.  "But it wasn't a coincidence at all."  "Why not?"  "Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay."  Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.  "He wants to know--" continued Jordan "--if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over."  The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could "come over" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.  "Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?"  "He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see he's a regular tough underneath it all."  Something worried me.  "Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?"  "He wants her to see his house," she explained. "And your house is right next door."  "Oh!"  "I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night," went on Jordan, "but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:  " 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to see her right next door.'  "When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name."  It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: "There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."  "And Daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured Jordan to me.  "Does she want to see Gatsby?"  "She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're just supposed to invite her to tea."  We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.         When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire. Two o'clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsby's house, lit from tower to cellar.  At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into "hide-and-go-seek" or "sardines-in-the-box" with all the house thrown open to the game. But there wasn't a sound. Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.  "Your place looks like the world's fair," I said.  "Does it?" He turned his eyes toward it absently. "I have been glancing into some of the rooms. Let's go to Coney Island, old sport. In my car."  "It's too late."  "Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven't made use of it all summer."  "I've got to go to bed."  "All right."  He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.  "I talked with Miss Baker," I said after a moment. "I'm going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea."  "Oh, that's all right," he said carelessly. "I don't want to put you to any trouble."  "What day would suit you?"  "What day would suit YOU?" he corrected me quickly. "I don't want to put you to any trouble, you see."  "How about the day after tomorrow?" He considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance:  "I want to get the grass cut," he said.  We both looked at the grass--there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I suspected that he meant my grass.  "There's another little thing," he said uncertainly, and hesitated.  "Would you rather put it off for a few days?" I asked.  "Oh, it isn't about that. At least----" He fumbled with a series of beginnings. "Why, I thought--why, look here, old sport, you don't make much money, do you?"  "Not very much."  This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.  "I thought you didn't, if you'll pardon my--you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand. And I thought that if you don't make very much--You're selling bonds, aren't you, old sport?"  "Trying to."  "Well, this would interest you. It wouldn't take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing."  I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.  "I've got my hands full," I said. "I'm much obliged but I couldn't take on any more work."  "You wouldn't have to do any business with Wolfshiem." Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the "gonnegtion" mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer, hoping I'd begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.  The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door. So I didn't know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he "glanced into rooms" while his house blazed gaudily on. I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea.  "Don't bring Tom," I warned her.  "What?"  "Don't bring Tom."  "Who is 'Tom'?" she asked innocently.  The day agreed upon was pouring rain. At eleven o'clock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.  The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o'clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby's, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in. He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.  "Is everything all right?" he asked immediately.  "The grass looks fine, if that's what you mean."  "What grass?" he inquired blankly. "Oh, the grass in the yard." He looked out the window at it, but judging from his expression I don't believe he saw a thing.  "Looks very good," he remarked vaguely. "One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four. I think it was 'The Journal.' Have you got everything you need in the shape of--of tea?"  I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn. Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.  "Will they do?" I asked.  "Of course, of course! They're fine!" and he added hollowly, ". . .old sport."  The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew. Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay's "Economics," starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside. Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home.  "Why's that?"  "Nobody's coming to tea. It's too late!" He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere. "I can't wait all day."  "Don't be silly; it's just two minutes to four."  He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane. We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard.  Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive. It stopped. Daisy's face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.  "Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?"  The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain. I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through. A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car.  "Are you in love with me," she said low in my ear. "Or why did I have to come alone?"  "That's the secret of Castle Rackrent. Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour."  "Come back in an hour, Ferdie." Then in a grave murmur, "His name is Ferdie."  "Does the gasoline affect his nose?"  "I don't think so," she said innocently. "Why?"  We went in. To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted.  "Well, that's funny!" I exclaimed.  "What's funny?"  She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front door. I went out and opened it. Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes.  With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room. It wasn't a bit funny. Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain.  For half a minute there wasn't a sound. Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy's voice on a clear artificial note.  "I certainly am awfully glad to see you again."  A pause; it endured horribly. I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room.  Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom. His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair.  "We've met before," muttered Gatsby. His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh. Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place. Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand.  "I'm sorry about the clock," he said.  My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn. I couldn't muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head.  "It's an old clock," I told them idiotically.  I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor.  "We haven't met for many years," said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.  "Five years next November."  The automatic quality of Gatsby's answer set us all back at least another minute. I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.  Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself. Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes. However, as calmness wasn't an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet.  "Where are you going?" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.  "I'll be back."  "I've got to speak to you about something before you go."  He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: "Oh, God!" in a miserable way.  "What's the matter?"  "This is a terrible mistake," he said, shaking his head from side to side, "a terrible, terrible mistake."  "You're just embarrassed, that's all," and luckily I added: "Daisy's embarrassed too."  "She's embarrassed?" he repeated incredulously.  "Just as much as you are."  "Don't talk so loud."  "You're acting like a little boy," I broke out impatiently. "Not only that but you're rude. Daisy's sitting in there all alone."   He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room.  I walked out the back way--just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour before--and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain. Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby's gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby's enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the "period" craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he'd agreed to pay five years' taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family--he went into an immediate decline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door. Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.  After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer's automobile rounded Gatsby's drive with the raw material for his servants' dinner--I felt sure he wouldn't eat a spoonful. A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too.  I went in--after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove--but I don't believe they heard a sound. They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone. Daisy's face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room.  "Oh, hello, old sport," he said, as if he hadn't seen me for years. I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands.  "It's stopped raining."  "Has it?" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy. "What do you think of that? It's stopped raining."  "I'm glad, Jay." Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.  "I want you and Daisy to come over to my house," he said, "I'd like to show her around."  "You're sure you want me to come?"  "Absolutely, old sport."  Daisy went upstairs to wash her face--too late I thought with humiliation of my towels--while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.  "My house looks well, doesn't it?" he demanded. "See how the whole front of it catches the light."  I agreed that it was splendid.  "Yes." His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. "It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it."  "I thought you inherited your money."  "I did, old sport," he said automatically, "but I lost most of it in the big panic--the panic of the war."  I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered "That's my affair," before he realized that it wasn't the appropriate reply.  "Oh, I've been in several things," he corrected himself. "I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business. But I'm not in either one now." He looked at me with more attention. "Do you mean you've been thinking over what I proposed the other night?"  Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.  "That huge place THERE?" she cried pointing.  "Do you like it?"  "I love it, but I don't see how you live there all alone."  "I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People who do interesting things. Celebrated people."  Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.  And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of "the Merton College Library" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.  We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths--intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It was Mr. Klipspringer, the "boarder." I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby's own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall.  He hadn't once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes. Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs.  His bedroom was the simplest room of all--except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.  "It's the funniest thing, old sport," he said hilariously. "I can't--when I try to----"  He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock.  Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.  "I've got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall."  He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher--shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue. Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.  "They're such beautiful shirts," she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds. "It makes me sad because I've never seen such--such beautiful shirts before."   After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers--but outside Gatsby's window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.  "If it wasn't for the mist we could see your home across the bay," said Gatsby. "You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock."  Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said. Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever. Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her. It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a green light on a dock. His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.  I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness. A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk.  "Who's this?"  "That? That's Mr. Dan Cody, old sport."  The name sounded faintly familiar.  "He's dead now. He used to be my best friend years ago."  There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau--Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly--taken apparently when he was about eighteen.  "I adore it!" exclaimed Daisy. "The pompadour! You never told me you had a pompadour--or a yacht."  "Look at this," said Gatsby quickly. "Here's a lot of clippings--about you."  They stood side by side examining it. I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver.  "Yes. . . . Well, I can't talk now. . . . I can't talk now, old sport. . . . I said a SMALL town. . . . He must know what a small town is. . . . Well, he's no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town. . . ."  He rang off.  "Come here QUICK!" cried Daisy at the window.  The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.  "Look at that," she whispered, and then after a moment: "I'd like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around."  I tried to go then, but they wouldn't hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone.  "I know what we'll do," said Gatsby, "we'll have Klipspringer play the piano."  He went out of the room calling "Ewing!" and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair. He was now decently clothed in a "sport shirt" open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue.  "Did we interrupt your exercises?" inquired Daisy politely.  "I was asleep," cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment. "That is, I'd BEEN asleep. Then I got up. . . ."  "Klipspringer plays the piano," said Gatsby, cutting him off. "Don't you, Ewing, old sport?"  "I don't play well. I don't--I hardly play at all. I'm all out of prac----"  "We'll go downstairs," interrupted Gatsby. He flipped a switch. The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light.  In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano. He lit Daisy's cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.  When Klipspringer had played "The Love Nest" he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.  "I'm all out of practice, you see. I told you I couldn't play. I'm all out of prac----"  "Don't talk so much, old sport," commanded Gatsby. "Play!"       IN THE MORNING,     IN THE EVENING,        AIN'T WE GOT FUN----  Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound. All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York. It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air.       ONE THING'S SURE AND NOTHING'S SURER     THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET--CHILDREN.        IN THE MEANTIME,        IN BETWEEN TIME----   As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby's face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness. Almost five years! There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams--not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion. It had gone beyond her, beyond everything. He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way. No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.  As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly. His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion. I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn't be over-dreamed--that voice was a deathless song.  They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn't know me now at all. I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life. Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.         About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had anything to say.  "Anything to say about what?" inquired Gatsby politely.  "Why,--any statement to give out."  It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby's name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out "to see."  It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right. Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news. Contemporary legends such as the "underground pipe-line to Canada" attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore. Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn't easy to say.  James Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour.  I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of God--a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that--and he must be about His Father's Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.  For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.  But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy's wing.  An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.  Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.  To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap. And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too.  He was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.  I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.  And it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.   He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.  It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened before.  They were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.  "I'm delighted to see you," said Gatsby standing on his porch. "I'm delighted that you dropped in."  As though they cared!  "Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar." He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. "I'll have something to drink for you in just a minute."  He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr. Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . I'm sorry----  "Did you have a nice ride?"  "Very good roads around here."  "I suppose the automobiles----"  "Yeah."  Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger.  "I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan."  "Oh, yes," said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering. "So we did. I remember very well."  "About two weeks ago."  "That's right. You were with Nick here."  "I know your wife," continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.  "That so?"  Tom turned to me.  "You live near here, Nick?"  "Next door."  "That so?"  Mr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either--until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.  "We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby," she suggested. "What do you say?"  "Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you."  "Be ver' nice," said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. "Well--think ought to be starting home."  "Please don't hurry," Gatsby urged them. He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. "Why don't you--why don't you stay for supper? I wouldn't be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York."  "You come to supper with ME," said the lady enthusiastically. "Both of you."  This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.  "Come along," he said--but to her only.  "I mean it," she insisted. "I'd love to have you. Lots of room."  Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.  "I'm afraid I won't be able to," I said.  "Well, you come," she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.  Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.  "We won't be late if we start now," she insisted aloud.  "I haven't got a horse," said Gatsby. "I used to ride in the army but I've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in my car. Excuse me for just a minute."  The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside.  "My God, I believe the man's coming," said Tom. "Doesn't he know she doesn't want him?"  "She says she does want him."  "She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there." He frowned. "I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish."  Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses.  "Come on," said Mr. Sloane to Tom, "we're late. We've got to go." And then to me: "Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?"  Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door.  Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy's running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby's party. Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness--it stands out in my memory from Gatsby's other parties that summer. There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn't been there before. Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy's eyes. It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.  They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisy's voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.  "These things excite me SO," she whispered. "If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I'll be glad to arrange it for you. Just mention my name. Or present a green card. I'm giving out green----"  "Look around," suggested Gatsby.  "I'm looking around. I'm having a marvelous----"  "You must see the faces of many people you've heard about."  Tom's arrogant eyes roamed the crowd.  "We don't go around very much," he said. "In fact I was just thinking I don't know a soul here."  "Perhaps you know that lady." Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree. Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.  "She's lovely," said Daisy.  "The man bending over her is her director."  He took them ceremoniously from group to group:  "Mrs. Buchanan . . . and Mr. Buchanan----" After an instant's hesitation he added: "the polo player."  "Oh no," objected Tom quickly, "Not me."  But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained "the polo player" for the rest of the evening.  "I've never met so many celebrities!" Daisy exclaimed. "I liked that man--what was his name?--with the sort of blue nose."  Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer.  "Well, I liked him anyhow."  "I'd a little rather not be the polo player," said Tom pleasantly, "I'd rather look at all these famous people in--in oblivion."  Daisy and Gatsby danced. I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot--I had never seen him dance before. Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden: "In case there's a fire or a flood," she explained, "or any act of God."  Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together. "Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?" he said. "A fellow's getting off some funny stuff."  "Go ahead," answered Daisy genially, "And if you want to take down any addresses here's my little gold pencil. . . ." She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was "common but pretty," and I knew that except for the half hour she'd been alone with Gatsby she wasn't having a good time.  We were at a particularly tipsy table. That was my fault--Gatsby had been called to the phone and I'd enjoyed these same people only two weeks before. But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now.  "How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?"  The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder. At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes.  "Wha?"  A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker's defence:  "Oh, she's all right now. When she's had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that. I tell her she ought to leave it alone."  "I do leave it alone," affirmed the accused hollowly.  "We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: 'There's somebody that needs your help, Doc.' "  "She's much obliged, I'm sure," said another friend, without gratitude. "But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool."  "Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool," mumbled Miss Baedeker. "They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey."  "Then you ought to leave it alone," countered Doctor Civet.  "Speak for yourself!" cried Miss Baedeker violently. "Your hand shakes. I wouldn't let you operate on me!"  It was like that. Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star. They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between. It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek.  "I like her," said Daisy, "I think she's lovely."  But the rest offended her--and inarguably, because it wasn't a gesture but an emotion. She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented "place" that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village--appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing. She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand.  I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car. It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning. Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass.  "Who is this Gatsby anyhow?" demanded Tom suddenly. "Some big bootlegger?"  "Where'd you hear that?" I inquired.  "I didn't hear it. I imagined it. A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know."  "Not Gatsby," I said shortly.  He was silent for a moment. The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet.  "Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together."  A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy's fur collar.  "At least they're more interesting than the people we know," she said with an effort.  "You didn't look so interested."  "Well, I was."  Tom laughed and turned to me.  "Did you notice Daisy's face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?"  Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.  "Lots of people come who haven't been invited," she said suddenly. "That girl hadn't been invited. They simply force their way in and he's too polite to object."  "I'd like to know who he is and what he does," insisted Tom. "And I think I'll make a point of finding out."  "I can tell you right now," she answered. "He owned some drug stores, a lot of drug stores. He built them up himself."  The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive.  "Good night, Nick," said Daisy.  Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where "Three o'Clock in the Morning," a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby's party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside? What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours? Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion.   I stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead. When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.  "She didn't like it," he said immediately.  "Of course she did."  "She didn't like it," he insisted. "She didn't have a good time."  He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression.  "I feel far away from her," he said. "It's hard to make her understand."  "You mean about the dance?"  "The dance?" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers. "Old sport, the dance is unimportant."  He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: "I never loved you." After she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house--just as if it were five years ago.  "And she doesn't understand," he said. "She used to be able to understand. We'd sit for hours----"  He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers.  "I wouldn't ask too much of her," I ventured. "You can't repeat the past."  "Can't repeat the past?" he cried incredulously. "Why of course you can!"  He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.  "I'm going to fix everything just the way it was before," he said, nodding determinedly. "She'll see."  He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was. . . .  . . . One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They stopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees--he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.  His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.  Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something--an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air. But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever.         It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night--and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.  Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away. Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out--an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.  "Is Mr. Gatsby sick?"  "Nope." After a pause he added "sir" in a dilatory, grudging way.  "I hadn't seen him around, and I was rather worried. Tell him Mr. Carraway came over."  "Who?" he demanded rudely.  "Carraway."  "Carraway. All right, I'll tell him." Abruptly he slammed the door.  My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone. The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren't servants at all.  Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.  "Going away?" I inquired.  "No, old sport."  "I hear you fired all your servants."  "I wanted somebody who wouldn't gossip. Daisy comes over quite often--in the afternoons."  So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes.  "They're some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for. They're all brothers and sisters. They used to run a small hotel."  "I see."  He was calling up at Daisy's request--would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow? Miss Baker would be there. Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming. Something was up. And yet I couldn't believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene--especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.  The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer. As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.  "Oh, my!" she gasped.  I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm's length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it--but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same.  "Hot!" said the conductor to familiar faces. "Some weather! Hot! Hot! Hot! Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it . . . ?"  My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand. That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!  . . . Through the hall of the Buchanans' house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.  "The master's body!" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. "I'm sorry, madame, but we can't furnish it--it's far too hot to touch this noon!"  What he really said was: "Yes . . . yes . . . I'll see."  He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.  "Madame expects you in the salon!" he cried, needlessly indicating the direction. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life.  The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.  "We can't move," they said together.  Jordan's fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine.  "And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?" I inquired.  Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone.  Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.  "The rumor is," whispered Jordan, "that that's Tom's girl on the telephone."  We were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance. "Very well, then, I won't sell you the car at all. . . . I'm under no obligations to you at all. . . . And as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I won't stand that at all!"  "Holding down the receiver," said Daisy cynically.  "No, he's not," I assured her. "It's a bona fide deal. I happen to know about it."  Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room.  "Mr. Gatsby!" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike. "I'm glad to see you, sir. . . . Nick. . . ."  "Make us a cold drink," cried Daisy.  As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth.  "You know I love you," she murmured.  "You forget there's a lady present," said Jordan.  Daisy looked around doubtfully.  "You kiss Nick too."  "What a low, vulgar girl!"  "I don't care!" cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace. Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.  "Bles-sed pre-cious," she crooned, holding out her arms. "Come to your own mother that loves you."  The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother's dress.  "The Bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair? Stand up now, and say How-de-do."  Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand. Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don't think he had ever really believed in its existence before.  "I got dressed before luncheon," said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy.  "That's because your mother wanted to show you off." Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck. "You dream, you. You absolute little dream."  "Yes," admitted the child calmly. "Aunt Jordan's got on a white dress too."  "How do you like mother's friends?" Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby. "Do you think they're pretty?"  "Where's Daddy?"  "She doesn't look like her father," explained Daisy. "She looks like me. She's got my hair and shape of the face."  Daisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand.  "Come, Pammy."  "Goodbye, sweetheart!"  With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse's hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.  Gatsby took up his drink.  "They certainly look cool," he said, with visible tension.  We drank in long greedy swallows.  "I read somewhere that the sun's getting hotter every year," said Tom genially. "It seems that pretty soon the earth's going to fall into the sun--or wait a minute--it's just the opposite--the sun's getting colder every year.  "Come outside," he suggested to Gatsby, "I'd like you to have a look at the place."  I went with them out to the veranda. On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea. Gatsby's eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay.  "I'm right across from you."  "So you are."  Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore. Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky. Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles.  "There's sport for you," said Tom, nodding. "I'd like to be out there with him for about an hour."  We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale.  "What'll we do with ourselves this afternoon," cried Daisy, "and the day after that, and the next thirty years?"  "Don't be morbid," Jordan said. "Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall."  "But it's so hot," insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, "And everything's so confused. Let's all go to town!"  Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.  "I've heard of making a garage out of a stable," Tom was saying to Gatsby, "but I'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage."  "Who wants to go to town?" demanded Daisy insistently. Gatsby's eyes floated toward her. "Ah," she cried, "you look so cool."  Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. With an effort she glanced down at the table.  "You always look so cool," she repeated.  She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw. He was astounded. His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.  "You resemble the advertisement of the man," she went on innocently. "You know the advertisement of the man----"  "All right," broke in Tom quickly, "I'm perfectly willing to go to town. Come on--we're all going to town."  He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife. No one moved.  "Come on!" His temper cracked a little. "What's the matter, anyhow? If we're going to town let's start."  His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale. Daisy's voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive.  "Are we just going to go?" she objected. "Like this? Aren't we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?"  "Everybody smoked all through lunch."  "Oh, let's have fun," she begged him. "It's too hot to fuss."  He didn't answer.  "Have it your own way," she said. "Come on, Jordan."  They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet. A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky. Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.  "Have you got your stables here?" asked Gatsby with an effort.  "About a quarter of a mile down the road."  "Oh."  A pause.  "I don't see the idea of going to town," broke out Tom savagely. "Women get these notions in their heads----"  "Shall we take anything to drink?" called Daisy from an upper window.  "I'll get some whiskey," answered Tom. He went inside.  Gatsby turned to me rigidly:  "I can't say anything in his house, old sport."  "She's got an indiscreet voice," I remarked. "It's full of----"  I hesitated.  "Her voice is full of money," he said suddenly.  That was it. I'd never understood before. It was full of money--that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals' song of it. . . . High in a white palace the king's daughter, the golden girl. . . .  Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms.  "Shall we all go in my car?" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green leather of the seat. "I ought to have left it in the shade."  "Is it standard shift?" demanded Tom.  "Yes."  "Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town."  The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.  "I don't think there's much gas," he objected.  "Plenty of gas," said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. "And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store. You can buy anything at a drug store nowadays."  A pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby's face.  "Come on, Daisy," said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby's car. "I'll take you in this circus wagon."  He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm.  "You take Nick and Jordan. We'll follow you in the coupé."  She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby's car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind.  "Did you see that?" demanded Tom.  "See what?"  He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along.  "You think I'm pretty dumb, don't you?" he suggested. "Perhaps I am, but I have a--almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do. Maybe you don't believe that, but science----"  He paused. The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss.  "I've made a small investigation of this fellow," he continued. "I could have gone deeper if I'd known----"  "Do you mean you've been to a medium?" inquired Jordan humorously.  "What?" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. "A medium?"  "About Gatsby."  "About Gatsby! No, I haven't. I said I'd been making a small investigation of his past."  "And you found he was an Oxford man," said Jordan helpfully.  "An Oxford man!" He was incredulous. "Like hell he is! He wears a pink suit."  "Nevertheless he's an Oxford man."  "Oxford, New Mexico," snorted Tom contemptuously, "or something like that."  "Listen, Tom. If you're such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?" demanded Jordan crossly.  "Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married--God knows where!"  We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it, we drove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg's faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby's caution about gasoline.  "We've got enough to get us to town," said Tom.  "But there's a garage right here," objected Jordan. "I don't want to get stalled in this baking heat."  Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson's sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.  "Let's have some gas!" cried Tom roughly. "What do you think we stopped for--to admire the view?"  "I'm sick," said Wilson without moving. "I been sick all day."  "What's the matter?"  "I'm all run down."  "Well, shall I help myself?" Tom demanded. "You sounded well enough on the phone."  With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his face was green.  "I didn't mean to interrupt your lunch," he said. "But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car."  "How do you like this one?" inquired Tom. "I bought it last week."  "It's a nice yellow one," said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.  "Like to buy it?"  "Big chance," Wilson smiled faintly. "No, but I could make some money on the other."  "What do you want money for, all of a sudden?"  "I've been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go west."  "Your wife does!" exclaimed Tom, startled.  "She's been talking about it for ten years." He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes. "And now she's going whether she wants to or not. I'm going to get her away."  The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.  "What do I owe you?" demanded Tom harshly.  "I just got wised up to something funny the last two days," remarked Wilson. "That's why I want to get away. That's why I been bothering you about the car."  "What do I owe you?"  "Dollar twenty."  The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn't alighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before--and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty--as if he had just got some poor girl with child.  "I'll let you have that car," said Tom. "I'll send it over tomorrow afternoon."  That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind. Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away.  In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar--it was an expression I had often seen on women's faces but on Myrtle Wilson's face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.   There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé.  "Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool," suggested Jordan. "I love New York on summer afternoons when every one's away. There's something very sensuous about it--overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands."  The word "sensuous" had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.  "Where are we going?" she cried.  "How about the movies?"  "It's so hot," she complained. "You go. We'll ride around and meet you after." With an effort her wit rose faintly, "We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes."  "We can't argue about it here," Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us. "You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza."  Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever.  But they didn't. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.  The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back. The notion originated with Daisy's suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as "a place to have a mint julep." Each of us said over and over that it was a "crazy idea"--we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny. . . .  The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.  "It's a swell suite," whispered Jordan respectfully and every one laughed.  "Open another window," commanded Daisy, without turning around.  "There aren't any more."  "Well, we'd better telephone for an axe----"  "The thing to do is to forget about the heat," said Tom impatiently. "You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it."  He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table.  "Why not let her alone, old sport?" remarked Gatsby. "You're the one that wanted to come to town."  There was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered "Excuse me"--but this time no one laughed.  "I'll pick it up," I offered.  "I've got it." Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered "Hum!" in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.  "That's a great expression of yours, isn't it?" said Tom sharply.  "What is?"  "All this 'old sport' business. Where'd you pick that up?"  "Now see here, Tom," said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, "if you're going to make personal remarks I won't stay here a minute. Call up and order some ice for the mint julep."  As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn's Wedding March from the ballroom below.  "Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!" cried Jordan dismally.  "Still--I was married in the middle of June," Daisy remembered, "Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?"  "Biloxi," he answered shortly.  "A man named Biloxi. 'Blocks' Biloxi, and he made boxes--that's a fact--and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee."  "They carried him into my house," appended Jordan, "because we lived just two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died." After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, "There wasn't any connection."  "I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis," I remarked.  "That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he left. He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today."  The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of "Yea--ea--ea!" and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.  "We're getting old," said Daisy. "If we were young we'd rise and dance."  "Remember Biloxi," Jordan warned her. "Where'd you know him, Tom?"  "Biloxi?" He concentrated with an effort. "I didn't know him. He was a friend of Daisy's."  "He was not," she denied. "I'd never seen him before. He came down in the private car."  "Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him."  Jordan smiled.  "He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of your class at Yale."  Tom and I looked at each other blankly.  "BilOxi?"  "First place, we didn't have any president----"  Gatsby's foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.  "By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an Oxford man."  "Not exactly."  "Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford."  "Yes--I went there."  A pause. Then Tom's voice, incredulous and insulting:  "You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven."  Another pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his "Thank you" and the soft closing of the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.  "I told you I went there," said Gatsby.  "I heard you, but I'd like to know when."  "It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That's why I can't really call myself an Oxford man."  Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all looking at Gatsby.  "It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice," he continued. "We could go to any of the universities in England or France."  I wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I'd experienced before.  Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.  "Open the whiskey, Tom," she ordered. "And I'll make you a mint julep. Then you won't seem so stupid to yourself. . . . Look at the mint!"  "Wait a minute," snapped Tom, "I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question."  "Go on," Gatsby said politely.  "What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?"  They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.  "He isn't causing a row." Daisy looked desperately from one to the other. "You're causing a row. Please have a little self control."  "Self control!" repeated Tom incredulously. "I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife. Well, if that's the idea you can count me out. . . . Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they'll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white."  Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization.  "We're all white here," murmured Jordan.  "I know I'm not very popular. I don't give big parties. I suppose you've got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends--in the modern world."  Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so complete.  "I've got something to tell YOU, old sport,----" began Gatsby. But Daisy guessed at his intention.  "Please don't!" she interrupted helplessly. "Please let's all go home. Why don't we all go home?"  "That's a good idea." I got up. "Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink."  "I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me."  "Your wife doesn't love you," said Gatsby. "She's never loved you. She loves me."  "You must be crazy!" exclaimed Tom automatically.  Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.  "She never loved you, do you hear?" he cried. "She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!"  At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain--as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions.  "Sit down Daisy." Tom's voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note. "What's been going on? I want to hear all about it."  "I told you what's been going on," said Gatsby. "Going on for five years--and you didn't know."  Tom turned to Daisy sharply.  "You've been seeing this fellow for five years?"  "Not seeing," said Gatsby. "No, we couldn't meet. But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn't know. I used to laugh sometimes--"but there was no laughter in his eyes, "to think that you didn't know."  "Oh--that's all." Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair.  "You're crazy!" he exploded. "I can't speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn't know Daisy then--and I'll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door. But all the rest of that's a God Damned lie. Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now."  "No," said Gatsby, shaking his head.  "She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn't know what she's doing." He nodded sagely. "And what's more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time."  "You're revolting," said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: "Do you know why we left Chicago? I'm surprised that they didn't treat you to the story of that little spree."  Gatsby walked over and stood beside her.  "Daisy, that's all over now," he said earnestly. "It doesn't matter any more. Just tell him the truth--that you never loved him--and it's all wiped out forever."  She looked at him blindly. "Why,--how could I love him--possibly?"  "You never loved him."  She hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was doing--and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done now. It was too late.  "I never loved him," she said, with perceptible reluctance.  "Not at Kapiolani?" demanded Tom suddenly.  "No."  From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.  "Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?" There was a husky tenderness in his tone. ". . . Daisy?"  "Please don't." Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it. She looked at Gatsby. "There, Jay," she said--but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet.  "Oh, you want too much!" she cried to Gatsby. "I love you now--isn't that enough? I can't help what's past." She began to sob helplessly. "I did love him once--but I loved you too."  Gatsby's eyes opened and closed.  "You loved me TOO?" he repeated.  "Even that's a lie," said Tom savagely. "She didn't know you were alive. Why,--there're things between Daisy and me that you'll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget."  The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.  "I want to speak to Daisy alone," he insisted. "She's all excited now----"  "Even alone I can't say I never loved Tom," she admitted in a pitiful voice. "It wouldn't be true."  "Of course it wouldn't," agreed Tom.  She turned to her husband.  "As if it mattered to you," she said.  "Of course it matters. I'm going to take better care of you from now on."  "You don't understand," said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. "You're not going to take care of her any more."  "I'm not?" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to control himself now. "Why's that?"  "Daisy's leaving you."  "Nonsense."  "I am, though," she said with a visible effort.  "She's not leaving me!" Tom's words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby. "Certainly not for a common swindler who'd have to steal the ring he put on her finger."  "I won't stand this!" cried Daisy. "Oh, please let's get out."  "Who are you, anyhow?" broke out Tom. "You're one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem--that much I happen to know. I've made a little investigation into your affairs--and I'll carry it further tomorrow."  "You can suit yourself about that, old sport." said Gatsby steadily.  "I found out what your 'drug stores' were." He turned to us and spoke rapidly. "He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter. That's one of his little stunts. I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasn't far wrong."  "What about it?" said Gatsby politely. "I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn't too proud to come in on it."  "And you left him in the lurch, didn't you? You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU."  "He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport."  "Don't you call me 'old sport'!" cried Tom. Gatsby said nothing. "Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth."  That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby's face.  "That drug store business was just small change," continued Tom slowly, "but you've got something on now that Walter's afraid to tell me about."  I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin. Then I turned back to Gatsby--and was startled at his expression. He looked--and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden--as if he had "killed a man." For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way.  It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made. But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room.  The voice begged again to go.  "PLEASE, Tom! I can't stand this any more."  Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone.  "You two start on home, Daisy," said Tom. "In Mr. Gatsby's car."  She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn.  "Go on. He won't annoy you. I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over."  They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts even from our pity.  After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel.  "Want any of this stuff? Jordan? . . . Nick?"  I didn't answer.  "Nick?" He asked again.  "What?"  "Want any?"  "No . . . I just remembered that today's my birthday."  I was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade.  It was seven o'clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind. Thirty--the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat's shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.  So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.   The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his office--really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused, saying that he'd miss a lot of business if he did. While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead.  "I've got my wife locked in up there," explained Wilson calmly. "She's going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we're going to move away."  Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement. Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn't working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road. When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way. He was his wife's man and not his own.  So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn't say a word--instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he'd been doing at certain times on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he didn't. He supposed he forgot to, that's all. When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson's voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.  "Beat me!" he heard her cry. "Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!"  A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.  The "death car" as the newspapers called it, didn't stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend. Michaelis wasn't even sure of its color--he told the first policeman that it was light green. The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust.  Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.   We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.  "Wreck!" said Tom. "That's good. Wilson'll have a little business at last."  He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.  "We'll take a look," he said doubtfully, "just a look."  I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words "Oh, my God!" uttered over and over in a gasping moan.  "There's some bad trouble here," said Tom excitedly.  He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through.  The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.  Myrtle Wilson's body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I couldn't find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage--then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call.  "O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!"  Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman.  "M-a-v--" the policeman was saying, "--o----"  "No,--r--" corrected the man, "M-a-v-r-o----"  "Listen to me!" muttered Tom fiercely.  "r--" said the policeman, "o----"  "g----"  "g--" He looked up as Tom's broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder. "What you want, fella?"  "What happened--that's what I want to know!"  "Auto hit her. Ins'antly killed."  "Instantly killed," repeated Tom, staring.  "She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn't even stopus car."  "There was two cars," said Michaelis, "one comin', one goin', see?"  "Going where?" asked the policeman keenly.  "One goin' each way. Well, she--" His hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, "--she ran out there an' the one comin' from N'York knock right into her goin' thirty or forty miles an hour."  "What's the name of this place here?" demanded the officer.  "Hasn't got any name."  A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near.  "It was a yellow car," he said, "big yellow car. New."  "See the accident?" asked the policeman.  "No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster'n forty. Going fifty, sixty."  "Come here and let's have your name. Look out now. I want to get his name."  Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries.  "You don't have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind of car it was!"  Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms.  "You've got to pull yourself together," he said with soothing gruffness.  Wilson's eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.  "Listen," said Tom, shaking him a little. "I just got here a minute ago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we've been talking about. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn't mine, do you hear? I haven't seen it all afternoon."  Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.  "What's all that?" he demanded.  "I'm a friend of his." Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson's body. "He says he knows the car that did it. . . . It was a yellow car."  Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.  "And what color's your car?"  "It's a blue car, a coupé."  "We've come straight from New York," I said.  Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away.  "Now, if you'll let me have that name again correct----"  Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back.  "If somebody'll come here and sit with him!" he snapped authoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table. As he passed close to me he whispered "Let's get out."  Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.  Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend--then his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.  "The God Damn coward!" he whimpered. "He didn't even stop his car."   The Buchanans' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.  "Daisy's home," he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.  "I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There's nothing we can do tonight."  A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision. As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.  "I'll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you're waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper--if you want any." He opened the door. "Come in."  "No thanks. But I'd be glad if you'd order me the taxi. I'll wait outside."  Jordan put her hand on my arm.  "Won't you come in, Nick?"  "No thanks."  I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan lingered for a moment more.  "It's only half past nine," she said.  I'd be damned if I'd go in; I'd had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler's voice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate.  I hadn't gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.  "What are you doing?" I inquired.  "Just standing here, old sport."  Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn't have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of "Wolfshiem's people," behind him in the dark shrubbery.  "Did you see any trouble on the road?" he asked after a minute.  "Yes."  He hesitated.  "Was she killed?"  "Yes."  "I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It's better that the shock should all come at once. She stood it pretty well."  He spoke as if Daisy's reaction was the only thing that mattered.  "I got to West Egg by a side road," he went on, "and left the car in my garage. I don't think anybody saw us but of course I can't be sure."  I disliked him so much by this time that I didn't find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.  "Who was the woman?" he inquired.  "Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did it happen?"  "Well, I tried to swing the wheel----" He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.  "Was Daisy driving?"  "Yes," he said after a moment, "but of course I'll say I was. You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive--and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock--it must have killed her instantly."  "It ripped her open----"  "Don't tell me, old sport." He winced. "Anyhow--Daisy stepped on it. I tried to make her stop, but she couldn't so I pulled on the emergency brake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.  "She'll be all right tomorrow," he said presently. "I'm just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon. She's locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality she's going to turn the light out and on again."  "He won't touch her," I said. "He's not thinking about her."  "I don't trust him, old sport."  "How long are you going to wait?"  "All night if necessary. Anyhow till they all go to bed."  A new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it--he might think anything. I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy's room on the second floor.  "You wait here," I said. "I'll see if there's any sign of a commotion."  I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill.  Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale. He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.  They weren't happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale--and yet they weren't unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.  As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.  "Is it all quiet up there?" he asked anxiously.  "Yes, it's all quiet." I hesitated. "You'd better come home and get some sleep."  He shook his head.  "I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport."  He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight--watching over nothing.         I couldn't sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams. Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby's drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress--I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning would be too late.  Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.  "Nothing happened," he said wanly. "I waited, and about four o'clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light."  His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes. We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches--once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano. There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn't been aired for many days. I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside. Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.  "You ought to go away," I said. "It's pretty certain they'll trace your car."  "Go away NOW, old sport?"  "Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal."  He wouldn't consider it. He couldn't possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do. He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn't bear to shake him free.  It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody--told it to me because "Jay Gatsby" had broken up like glass against Tom's hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.  She was the first "nice" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there--it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.  But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously--eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.  He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself--that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of fact he had no such facilities--he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.  But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go--but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn't realize just how extraordinary a "nice" girl could be. She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.  When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.   "I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too. She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. . . . Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn't care. What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?"  On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.   He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns. After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He was worried now--there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy's letters. She didn't see why he couldn't come. She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.  For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the "Beale Street Blues" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.  Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision must be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that was close at hand.  That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.   It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light. The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day.  "I don't think she ever loved him." Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly. "You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon. He told her those things in a way that frightened her--that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper. And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying."  He sat down gloomily.  "Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were first married--and loved me more even then, do you see?"  Suddenly he came out with a curious remark:  "In any case," he said, "it was just personal."  What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn't be measured?  He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay. He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. Just as Daisy's house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.  He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found her--that he was leaving her behind. The day-coach--he was penniless now--was hot. He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.  The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath. He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him. But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.   It was nine o'clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch. The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air. The gardener, the last one of Gatsby's former servants, came to the foot of the steps.  "I'm going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves'll start falling pretty soon and then there's always trouble with the pipes."  "Don't do it today," Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically. "You know, old sport, I've never used that pool all summer?"  I looked at my watch and stood up.  "Twelve minutes to my train."  I didn't want to go to the city. I wasn't worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that--I didn't want to leave Gatsby. I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.  "I'll call you up," I said finally.  "Do, old sport."  "I'll call you about noon."  We walked slowly down the steps.  "I suppose Daisy'll call too." He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped I'd corroborate this.  "I suppose so."  "Well--goodbye."  We shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.  "They're a rotten crowd," I shouted across the lawn. "You're worth the whole damn bunch put together."  I've always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we'd been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before. The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption--and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.  I thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for that--I and the others.  "Goodbye," I called. "I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby."   Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair. Just before noon the phone woke me and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead. It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way. Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.  "I've left Daisy's house," she said. "I'm at Hempstead and I'm going down to Southampton this afternoon."  Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy's house, but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid.  "You weren't so nice to me last night."  "How could it have mattered then?"  Silence for a moment. Then--  "However--I want to see you."  "I want to see you too."  "Suppose I don't go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?"  "No--I don't think this afternoon."  "Very well."  "It's impossible this afternoon. Various----"  We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren't talking any longer. I don't know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didn't care. I couldn't have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world.  I called Gatsby's house a few minutes later, but the line was busy. I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit. Taking out my time-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train. Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think. It was just noon.   When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car. I suppose there'd be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson's tragic achievement was forgotten. Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before.  They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine. She must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flushing. When they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair. Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister's body.  Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside. For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it. Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door. Michaelis and several other men were with him--first four or five men, later two or three men. Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee. After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn.  About three o'clock the quality of Wilson's incoherent muttering changed--he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car. He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.  But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry "Oh, my God!" again in his groaning voice. Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.  "How long have you been married, George? Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question. How long have you been married?"  "Twelve years."  "Ever had any children? Come on, George, sit still--I asked you a question. Did you ever have any children?"  The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn't stopped a few hours before. He didn't like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office--he knew every object in it before morning--and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.  "Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George? Maybe even if you haven't been there for a long time? Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?"  "Don't belong to any."  "You ought to have a church, George, for times like this. You must have gone to church once. Didn't you get married in a church? Listen, George, listen to me. Didn't you get married in a church?"  "That was a long time ago."  The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking--for a moment he was silent. Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.  "Look in the drawer there," he said, pointing at the desk.  "Which drawer?"  "That drawer--that one."  Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand. There was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver. It was apparently new.  "This?" he inquired, holding it up.  Wilson stared and nodded.  "I found it yesterday afternoon. She tried to tell me about it but I knew it was something funny."  "You mean your wife bought it?"  "She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau."  Michaelis didn't see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash. But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying "Oh, my God!" again in a whisper--his comforter left several explanations in the air.  "Then he killed her," said Wilson. His mouth dropped open suddenly.  "Who did?"  "I have a way of finding out."  "You're morbid, George," said his friend. "This has been a strain to you and you don't know what you're saying. You'd better try and sit quiet till morning."  "He murdered her."  "It was an accident, George."  Wilson shook his head. His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior "Hm!"  "I know," he said definitely, "I'm one of these trusting fellas and I don't think any harm to NObody, but when I get to know a thing I know it. It was the man in that car. She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn't stop."  Michaelis had seen this too but it hadn't occurred to him that there was any special significance in it. He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.  "How could she of been like that?"  "She's a deep one," said Wilson, as if that answered the question. "Ah-h-h----"  He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand.  "Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?"  This was a forlorn hope--he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife. He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn't far off. About five o'clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light.  Wilson's glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.  "I spoke to her," he muttered, after a long silence. "I told her she might fool me but she couldn't fool God. I took her to the window--" With an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it, "--and I said 'God knows what you've been doing, everything you've been doing. You may fool me but you can't fool God!' "  Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night.  "God sees everything," repeated Wilson.  "That's an advertisement," Michaelis assured him. Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room. But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.   By six o'clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone.  His movements--he was on foot all the time--were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad's Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didn't eat and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didn't reach Gad's Hill until noon. Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time--there were boys who had seen a man "acting sort of crazy" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared from view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he "had a way of finding out," supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car. On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward--and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know. By half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby's house. So by that time he knew Gatsby's name.   At two o'clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn't to be taken out under any circumstances--and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair.  Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.  No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o'clock--until long after there was any one to give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn't believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream. He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about . . . like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.  The chauffeur--he was one of Wolfshiem's protégés--heard the shots--afterward he could only say that he hadn't thought anything much about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby's house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one. But they knew then, I firmly believe. With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool.  There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other. With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool. A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden. The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water.  It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson's body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.         After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby's front door. A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression "mad man" as he bent over Wilson's body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.  Most of those reports were a nightmare--grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue. When Michaelis's testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson's suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade--but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn't say a word. She showed a surprising amount of character about it too--looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a man "deranged by grief" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form. And it rested there.  But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself on Gatsby's side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn't move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested--interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end.  I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.  "Left no address?"  "No."  "Say when they'd be back?"  "No."  "Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?"  "I don't know. Can't say."  I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: "I'll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don't worry. Just trust me and I'll get somebody for you----"  Meyer Wolfshiem's name wasn't in the phone book. The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone.  "Will you ring again?"  "I've rung them three times."  "It's very important."  "Sorry. I'm afraid no one's there."  I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it. But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain.  "Look here, old sport, you've got to get somebody for me. You've got to try hard. I can't go through this alone."  Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk--he'd never told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was nothing--only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall.  Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure he'd start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there'd be a wire from Daisy before noon--but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men. When the butler brought back Wolfshiem's answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.   _Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all. Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think. I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now. If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out.                                          Yours truly                                                       MEYER WOLFSHIEM_  and then hasty addenda beneath:  _Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all._   When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last. But the connection came through as a man's voice, very thin and far away.  "This is Slagle speaking. . . ."  "Yes?" The name was unfamiliar.  "Hell of a note, isn't it? Get my wire?"  "There haven't been any wires."  "Young Parke's in trouble," he said rapidly. "They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter. They got a circular from New York giving 'em the numbers just five minutes before. What d'you know about that, hey? You never can tell in these hick towns----"  "Hello!" I interrupted breathlessly. "Look here--this isn't Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby's dead."  There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.   I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota. It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.  It was Gatsby's father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat. He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat. But he wouldn't eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand.  "I saw it in the Chicago newspaper," he said. "It was all in the Chicago newspaper. I started right away."  "I didn't know how to reach you."  His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room.  "It was a mad man," he said. "He must have been mad."  "Wouldn't you like some coffee?" I urged him.  "I don't want anything. I'm all right now, Mr.----"  "Carraway."  "Well, I'm all right now. Where have they got Jimmy?"  I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there. Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away.  After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears. He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.  "I didn't know what you'd want, Mr. Gatsby----"  "Gatz is my name."  "--Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want to take the body west."  He shook his head.  "Jimmy always liked it better down East. He rose up to his position in the East. Were you a friend of my boy's, Mr.--?"  "We were close friends."  "He had a big future before him, you know. He was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here."  He touched his head impressively and I nodded.  "If he'd of lived he'd of been a great man. A man like James J. Hill. He'd of helped build up the country."  "That's true," I said, uncomfortably.  He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly--was instantly asleep.  That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name.  "This is Mr. Carraway," I said.  "Oh--" He sounded relieved. "This is Klipspringer."  I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby's grave. I didn't want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so I'd been calling up a few people myself. They were hard to find.  "The funeral's tomorrow," I said. "Three o'clock, here at the house. I wish you'd tell anybody who'd be interested."  "Oh, I will," he broke out hastily. "Of course I'm not likely to see anybody, but if I do."  His tone made me suspicious.  "Of course you'll be there yourself."  "Well, I'll certainly try. What I called up about is----"  "Wait a minute," I interrupted. "How about saying you'll come?"  "Well, the fact is--the truth of the matter is that I'm staying with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow. In fact there's a sort of picnic or something. Of course I'll do my very best to get away."  I ejaculated an unrestrained "Huh!" and he must have heard me for he went on nervously:  "What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there. I wonder if it'd be too much trouble to have the butler send them on. You see they're tennis shoes and I'm sort of helpless without them. My address is care of B. F.----"  I didn't hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver.  After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby--one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved. However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby's liquor and I should have known better than to call him.  The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn't seem to reach him any other way. The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked "The Swastika Holding Company" and at first there didn't seem to be any one inside. But when I'd shouted "Hello" several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes.  "Nobody's in," she said. "Mr. Wolfshiem's gone to Chicago."  The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle "The Rosary," tunelessly, inside.  "Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him."  "I can't get him back from Chicago, can I?"  At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem's called "Stella!" from the other side of the door.  "Leave your name on the desk," she said quickly. "I'll give it to him when he gets back."  "But I know he's there."  She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips.  "You young men think you can force your way in here any time," she scolded. "We're getting sickantired of it. When I say he's in Chicago, he's in ChiCAgo."  I mentioned Gatsby.  "Oh--h!" She looked at me over again. "Will you just--what was your name?"  She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.  "My memory goes back to when I first met him," he said. "A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war. He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn't buy some regular clothes. First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner's poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job. He hadn't eat anything for a couple of days. 'Come on have some lunch with me,' I sid. He ate more than four dollars' worth of food in half an hour."  "Did you start him in business?" I inquired.  "Start him! I made him."  "Oh."  "I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany. We were so thick like that in everything--" He held up two bulbous fingers "--always together."  I wondered if this partnership had included the World's Series transaction in 1919.  "Now he's dead," I said after a moment. "You were his closest friend, so I know you'll want to come to his funeral this afternoon."  "I'd like to come."  "Well, come then."  The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.  "I can't do it--I can't get mixed up in it," he said.  "There's nothing to get mixed up in. It's all over now."  "When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out. When I was a young man it was different--if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end. You may think that's sentimental but I mean it--to the bitter end."  I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up.  "Are you a college man?" he inquired suddenly.  For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a "gonnegtion" but he only nodded and shook my hand.  "Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead," he suggested. "After that my own rule is to let everything alone."  When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle. After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall. His pride in his son and in his son's possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me.  "Jimmy sent me this picture." He took out his wallet with trembling fingers. "Look there."  It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands. He pointed out every detail to me eagerly. "Look there!" and then sought admiration from my eyes. He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself.  "Jimmy sent it to me. I think it's a very pretty picture. It shows up well."  "Very well. Had you seen him lately?"  "He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now. Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now there was a reason for it. He knew he had a big future in front of him. And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me."  He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called "Hopalong Cassidy."  "Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy. It just shows you."  He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see. On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date September 12th, 1906. And underneath:   Rise from bed . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  6.00       A.M.

"It just shows you, don't it?"  "It just shows you."  "Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always had some resolves like this or something. Do you notice what he's got about improving his mind? He was always great for that. He told me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it."  He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me. I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use.  A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars. So did Gatsby's father. And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way. The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came.   About five o'clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate--first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby's station wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground. I looked around. It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby's books in the library one night three months before.  I'd never seen him since then. I don't know how he knew about the funeral or even his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby's grave.  I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn't sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur "Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on," and then the owl-eyed man said "Amen to that," in a brave voice.  We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate.  "I couldn't get to the house," he remarked.  "Neither could anybody else."  "Go on!" He started. "Why, my God! they used to go there by the hundreds."  He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in.  "The poor son-of-a-bitch," he said.   One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o'clock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That's and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations: "Are you going to the Ordways'? the Herseys'? the Schultzes'?" and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.  When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again.  That's my middle west--not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family's name. I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all--Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.  Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old--even then it had always for me a quality of distortion. West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a house--the wrong house. But no one knows the woman's name, and no one cares.  After Gatsby's death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.  There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair.  She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn't making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye.  "Nevertheless you did throw me over," said Jordan suddenly. "You threw me over on the telephone. I don't give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while."  We shook hands.  "Oh, and do you remember--" she added, "----a conversation we had once about driving a car?"  "Why--not exactly."  "You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? Well, I met another bad driver, didn't I? I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride."  "I'm thirty," I said. "I'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."  She didn't answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away.   One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand.  "What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?"  "Yes. You know what I think of you."  "You're crazy, Nick," he said quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't know what's the matter with you."  "Tom," I inquired, "what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?"  He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.  "I told him the truth," he said. "He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house----" He broke off defiantly. "What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and never even stopped his car."  There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn't true.  "And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it was awful----"  I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made. . . .  I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons--rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.   Gatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train.  I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I didn't investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn't know that the party was over.  On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand.  Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.  And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.  Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning----  So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.    THE END
Everybody was drunk. The whole battery was drunk going along the road in the dark. We were going to the Champagne. The lieutenant kept riding his horse out into the fields and saying to him, "I'm drunk, I tell you, mon vieux. Oh, I am so soused." We went along the road all night in the dark and the adjutant kept riding up alongside my kitchen and saying, "You must put it out. It is dangerous. It will be observed." We were fifty kilometers from the front, but the adjutant worried about the fire in my kitchen. It was funny going along that road. That was when I was a kitchen Corporal.  At the lake shore there was another rowboat drawn up. The two Indians stood waiting.  Nick and his father got in the stern of the boat and the Indians shoved it off and one of them got in to row. Uncle George sat in the stern of the camp rowboat. The young Indian shoved the camp boat off and got in to row Uncle George.  The two boats started off in the dark. Nick heard the oar-locks of the other boat quite a way ahead of them in the mist. The Indians rowed with quick choppy strokes. Nick lay back with his father's arm around him. It was cold on the water. The Indian who was rowing them was working very hard, but the other boat moved further ahead in the mist all the time.  "Where are we going, Dad?" Nick asked.  "Over to the Indian camp. There is an In苓ian lady very sick."  "Oh," said Nick.  Across the bay they found the other boat beached. Uncle George was smoking a cigar in the dark. The young Indian pulled the boat way up the beach. Uncle George gave both the Indians cigars.  They walked up from the beach through a meadow that was soaking wet with dew, follow虹ng the young Indian who carried a lantern. Then they went into the woods and followed a trail that led to the logging road that ran back into the hills. It was much lighter on the log茆ing road as the timber was cut away on both sides. The young Indian stopped and blew out his lantern and they all walked on along the road.  They came around a bend and a dog came out barking. Ahead were the lights of the shanties where the Indian bark-peelers lived. More dogs rushed out at them. The two Indians sent them back to the shanties. In the shanty nearest the road there was a light in the window. An old woman stood in the doorway holding a lamp.  Inside on a wooden bunk lay a young Indian woman. She had been trying to have her baby for two days. All the old women in the camp had been helping her. The men had moved off up the road to sit in the dark and smoke out of range of the noise she made. She screamed just as Nick and the two Indians followed his father and Uncle George into the shanty. She lay in the lower bunk, very big under a quilt. Her head was turned to one side. In the upper bunk was her husband. He had cut his foot very badly with an ax three days before. He was smoking a pipe. The room smelled very bad.  Nick's father ordered some water to be put on the stove, and while it was heating he spoke to Nick.  "This lady is going to have a baby, Nick," he said.  "I know," said Nick.  "You don't know," said his father. "Listen to me. What she is going through is called be虹ng in labor. The baby wants to be born and she wants it to be born. All her muscles are trying to get the baby born. That is what is happening when she screams."  "I see," Nick said.  Just then the woman cried out.  "Oh, Daddy, can't you give her something to make her stop screaming?" asked Nick.  "No. I haven't any anæsthetic," his father said. "But her screams are not important. I don't hear them because they are not important."  The husband in the upper bunk rolled over against the wall.  The woman in the kitchen motioned to the doctor that the water was hot. Nick's father went into the kitchen and poured about half of the water out of the big kettle into a basin. Into the water left in the kettle he put several things he unwrapped from a handkerchief.  "Those must boil," he said, and began to scrub his hands in the basin of hot water with a cake of soap he had brought from the camp. Nick watched his father's hands scrubbing each other with the soap. While his father washed his hands very carefully and thoroughly, he talked.  "You see, Nick, babies are supposed to be born head first but sometimes they're not. When they're not they make a lot of trouble for every苑ody. Maybe I'll have to operate on this lady. We'll know in a little while."  When he was satisfied with his hands he went in and went to work.  "Pull back that quilt, will you, George?" he said. "I'd rather not touch it."  Later when he started to operate Uncle George and three Indian men held the woman still. She bit Uncle George on the arm and Uncle George said, "Damn squaw bitch!" and the young Indian who had rowed Uncle George over laughed at him. Nick held the basin for his father. It all took a long time.  His father picked the baby up and slapped it to make it breathe and handed it to the old woman.  "See, it's a boy, Nick," he said. "How do you like being an interne?"  Nick said, "All right."	He was looking away so as not to see what his father was doing.  "There. That gets it," said his father and put something into the basin.  Nick didn't look at it.  "Now," his father said, "there's some stitches to put in. You can watch this or not, Nick, just as you like. I'm going to sew up the incision I made."  Nick did not watch. His curiosity has been gone for a long time.  His father finished and stood up. Uncle George and the three Indian men stood up. Nick put the basin out in the kitchen.  Uncle George looked at his arm. The young Indian smiled reminiscently.  "I'll put some peroxide on that, George," the doctor said.  He bent over the Indian woman. She was quiet now and her eyes were closed. She looked very pale. She did not know what had become of the baby or anything.  "I'll be back in the morning," the doctor said, standing up. "The nurse should be here from St. Ignace by noon and she'll bring everything we need."  He was feeling exalted and talkative as foot苑all players are in the dressing room after a game.  "That's one for the medical journal, George," he said. "Doing a Caesarian with a jack-knife and sewing it up with nine-foot, tapered gut leaders."  Uncle George was standing against the wall, looking at his arm.  "Oh, you're a great man, all right," he said.  "Ought to have a look at the proud father. They're usually the worst sufferers in these little affairs," the doctor said. "I must say he took it all pretty quietly."  He pulled back the blanket from the Indian's head. His hand came away wet. He mounted on the edge of the lower bunk with the lamp in one hand and looked in. The Indian lay with his face toward the wall. His throat had been cut from ear to ear. The blood had flowed down into a pool where his body sagged the bunk. His head rested on his left arm. The open razor lay, edge up, in the blankets.  "Take Nick out of the shanty, George," the doctor said.  There was no need of that. Nick, standing in the door of the kitchen, had a good view of the upper bunk when his father, the lamp in one hand, tipped the Indian's head back.  It was just beginning to be daylight when they walked along the logging road back toward the lake.  "I'm terribly sorry I brought you along, Nickie," said his father, all his post-operative exhilaration gone. "It was an awful mess to put you through."  "Do ladies always have such a hard time hav虹ng babies?" Nick asked.  "No, that was very, very exceptional."  "Why did he kill himself, Daddy?"  "I don't know, Nick. He couldn't stand things, I guess."  "Do many men kill themselves, Daddy?"  "Not very many, Nick."  "Do many women?"  "Hardly ever."  "Don't they ever?"  "Oh, yes. They do sometimes."  "Daddy?"  "Yes."  "Where did Uncle George go?"  "He'll turn up all right."  "Is dying hard, Daddy?"  "No, I think it's pretty easy, Nick. It all de計ends."  They were seated in the boat, Nick in the stern, his father rowing. The sun was coming up over the hills. A bass jumped, making a circle in the water. Nick trailed his hand in the water. It felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning.  In the early morning on the lake sitting in the stern of the boat with his father rowing, he felt quite sure that he would never die.  Maera lay still, his head on his arms, his face in the sand. He felt warm and sticky from the bleeding. Each time he felt the horn coming. Sometimes the bull only bumped him with his head. Once the horn went all the way through him and he felt it go into the sand. Someone had the bull by the tail. They were swearing at him and flopping the cape in his face. Then the bull was gone. Some men picked Maera up and started to run with him toward the barriers through the gate out the passage way around under the grandstand to the infirmary. They laid Maera down on a cot and one of the men went for the doctor. The doctor came running from the corral, where he had been sewing up picador horses. He had to stop and wash his hands. There was a great shouting going on in the grandstand overhead. Maera wanted to say something and found he could not talk. Maera felt everything getting larger and larger and then smaller and smaller. Then it got larger and larger and larger and then smaller and smaller. Then everything commenced to run faster and faster as when they speed up a cinematograph film. Then he was dead.  The train went on up the track out of sight, around one of the hills of burnt timber. Nick sat down on the bundle of canvas and bedding the baggage man had pitched out of the door of the baggage car. There was no town, nothing but the rails and the burned-over country. The thirteen saloons that had lined the one street of Seney had not left a trace. The foundations of the Mansion House hotel stuck up above the ground. The stone was chipped and split by the fire. It was all that was left of the town of Seney. Even the surface had been burned off the ground.  Nick looked at the burned-over stretch of hillside, where he had expected to find the scat負ered houses of the town and then walked down the railroad track to the bridge over the river. The river was there. It swirled against the log spiles of the bridge. Nick looked down into the clear, brown water, colored from the pebbly bot負om, and watched the trout keeping themselves steady in the current with wavering fins. As he watched them they changed their positions by quick angles, only to hold steady in the fast water again. Nick watched them a long time.  He watched them holding themselves with their noses into the current, many trout in deep, fast moving water, slightly distorted as he watched far down through the glassy convex surface of the pool, its surface pushing and swelling smooth against the resistance of the log苓riven piles of the bridge. At the bottom of the pool were the big trout. Nick did not see them at first. Then he saw them at the bottom of the pool, big trout looking to hold themselves on the gravel bottom in a varying mist of gravel and sand, raised in spurts by the current.  Nick looked down into the pool from the bridge. It was a hot day. A kingfisher flew up the stream. It was a long time since Nick had looked into a stream and seen trout.	They were very satisfactory. As the shadow of the king苯isher moved up the stream, a big trout shot up貞tream in a long angle, only his shadow marking the angle, then lost his shadow as he came through the surface of the water, caught the sun, and then, as he went back into the stream under the surface, his shadow seemed to float down the stream with the current, unresisting, to his post under the bridge where he tightened facing up into the current.  Nick's heart tightened as the trout moved. He felt all the old feeling.  He turned and looked down the stream. It stretched away, pebbly-bottomed with shallows and big boulders and a deep pool as it curved away around the foot of a bluff.  Nick walked back up the ties to where his pack lay in the cinders beside the railway track. He was happy. He adjusted the pack harness around the bundle, pulling straps tight, slung the pack on his back, got his arms through the shoulder straps and took some of the pull off his shoulders by leaning his forehead against the wide band of the tump-line. Still, it was too heavy. It was much too heavy. He had his leather rod-case in his hand and leaning forward to keep the weight of the pack high on his shoul苓ers he walked along the road that paralleled the railway track, leaving the burned town behind in the heat, and then turned off around a hill with a high, fire-scarred hill on either side onto a road that went back into the country. He walked along the road feeling the ache from the pull of the heavy pack. The road climbed stead虹ly. It was hard work walking up-hill. His muscles ached and the day was hot, but Nick felt happy. He felt he had left everything be虐ind, the need for thinking, the need to write, other needs. It was all back of him.  From the time he had gotten down off the train and the baggage man had thrown his pack out of the open car door things had been different. Seney was burned, the country was burned over and changed, but it did not matter. It could not all be burned. He knew that. He hiked along the road, sweating in the sun, climbing to cross the range of hills that separated the rail趴ay from the pine plains.  The road ran on, dipping occasionally, but always climbing. Nick went on up. Finally the road after going parallel to the burnt hillside reached the top. Nick leaned back against a stump and slipped out of the pack harness. Ahead of him, as far as he could see, was the pine plain. The burned country stopped off at the left with the range of hills. On ahead islands of dark pine trees rose out of the plain. Far off to the left was the line of the river. Nick followed it with his eye and caught glints of the water in the sun.  There was nothing but the pine plain ahead of him, until the far blue hills that marked the Lake Superior height of land. He could hardly see them, faint and far away in the heat-light over the plain. If he looked too steadily they were gone.	But if he only half-looked they were there, the far off hills of the height of land.  Nick sat down against the charred stump and smoked a cigarette. His pack balanced on the top of the stump, harness holding ready, a hol衍ow molded in it from his back. Nick sat smok虹ng, looking out over the country. He did not need to get his map out. He knew where he was from the position of the river.  As he smoked, his legs stretched out in front of him, he noticed a grasshopper walk along the ground and up onto his woolen sock. The grass虐opper was black. As he had walked along the road, climbing, he had started many grasshop計ers from the dust. They were all black. They were not the big grasshoppers with yellow and black or red and black wings whirring out from their black wing sheathing as they fly up. These were just ordinary hoppers, but all a sooty black in color. Nick had wondered about them as he walked, without really thinking about them. Now, as he watched the black hopper that was nibbling at the wool of his sock with its fourway lip, he realized that they had all turned black from living in the burned-over land. He realized that the fire must have come the year before, but the grasshoppers were all black now. He won苓ered how long they would stay that way.  Carefully he reached his hand down and took hold of the hopper by the wings. He turned him up, all his legs walking in the air, and looked at his jointed belly. Yes, it was black too, iridescent where the back and head were dusty.  "Go on, hopper," Nick said, speaking out loud for the first time, "Fly away somewhere."  He tossed the grasshopper up into the air and watched him sail away to a charcoal stump across the road.  Nick stood up. He leaned his back against the weight of his pack where it rested upright on the stump and got his arms through the shoul苓er straps. He stood with the pack on his back on the brow of the hill looking out across the country, toward the distant river and then struck down the hillside away from the road. Under苯oot the ground was good walking. Two hun苓red yards down the hillside the fire line stopped. Then it was sweet fern, growing ankle high, to walk through, and clumps of jack pines; a long undulating country with frequent rises and descents, sandy underfoot and the country alive again.  Nick kept his direction by the sun.	He knew where he wanted to strike the river and he kept on through the pine plain, mounting small rises to see other rises ahead of him and sometimes from the top of a rise a great solid island of pines off to his right or his left. He broke off some sprigs of the heathery sweet fern, and put them under his pack straps. The chafing crushed it and he smelled it as he walked.  He was tired and very hot, walking across the uneven, shadeless pine plain. At any time he knew he could strike the river by turning off to his left. It could not be more than a mile away. But he kept on toward the north to hit the river as far upstream as he could go in one day's walk虹ng.  For some time as he walked Nick had been in sight of one of the big islands of pine standing out above the rolling high ground he was cross虹ng. He dipped down and then as he came slowly up to the crest of the ridge he turned and made toward the pine trees.  There was no underbrush in the island of pine trees. The trunks of the trees went straight up or slanted toward each other. The trunks were straight and brown without branches. The branches were high above. Some interlocked to make a solid shadow on the brown forest floor. Around the grove of trees was a bare space. It was brown and soft underfoot as Nick walked on it. This was the over-lapping of the pine needle floor, extending out beyond the width of the high branches. The trees had grown tall and the branches moved high, leaving in the sun this bare space they had once covered with shadow. Sharp at the edge of this extension of the forest floor commenced the sweet fern.  Nick slipped off his pack and lay down in the shade. He lay on his back and looked up into the pine trees. His neck and back and the small of his back rested as he stretched. The earth felt good against his back. He looked up at the sky, through the branches, and then shut his eyes. He opened them and looked up again. There was a wind high up in the branches. He shut his eyes again and went to sleep.  Nick woke stiff and cramped. The sun was nearly down. His pack was heavy and the straps painful as he lifted it on. He leaned over with the pack on and picked up the leather rod-case and started out from the pine trees across the sweet fern swale, toward the river. He knew it could not be more than a mile.  He came down a hillside covered with stumps into a meadow. At the edge of the meadow flowed the river. Nick was glad to get to the river. He walked upstream through the meadow. His trousers were soaked with the dew as he walked. After the hot day, the dew had come quickly and heavily. The river made no sound. It was too fast and smooth. At the edge of the meadow, before he mounted to a piece of high ground to make camp, Nick looked down the river at the trout rising. They were rising to insects come from the swamp on the other side of the stream when the sun went down. The trout jumped out of water to take them. While Nick walked through the little stretch of meadow alongside the stream, trout had jumped high out of water.	Now as he looked down the river, the insects must be settling on the surface, for the trout were feeding steadily all down the stream. As far down the long stretch as he could see, the trout were rising, making circles all down the surface of the water, as though it were starting to rain.  The ground rose, wooded and sandy, to over衍ook the meadow, the stretch of river and the swamp. Nick dropped his pack and rod-case and looked for a level piece of ground. He was very hungry and he wanted to make his camp before he cooked. Between two jack pines, the ground was quite level. He took the ax out of the pack and chopped out two projecting roots. That leveled a piece of ground large enough to sleep on. He smoothed out the sandy soil with his hand and pulled all the sweet fern bushes by their roots. His hands smelled good from the sweet fern. He smoothed the uprooted earth. He did not want anything making lumps under the blankets. When he had the ground smooth, he spread his three blankets. One he folded double, next to the ground. The other two he spread on top.  With the ax he slit off a bright slab of pine from one of the stumps and split it into pegs for the tent. He wanted them long and solid to hold in the ground. With the tent unpacked and spread on the ground, the pack, leaning against a jackpine, looked much smaller. Nick tied the rope that served the tent for a ridge-pole to the trunk of one of the pine trees and pulled the tent up off the ground with the other end of the rope and tied it to the other pine. The tent hung on the rope like a canvas blanket on a clothes line. Nick poked a pole he had cut up under the back peak of the canvas and then made it a tent by pegging out the sides. He pegged the sides out taut and drove the pegs deep, hit負ing them down into the ground with the flat of the ax until the rope loops were buried and the canvas was drum tight.  Across the open mouth of the tent Nick fixed cheese cloth to keep out mosquitoes. He crawled inside under the mosquito bar with various things from the pack to put at the head of the bed under the slant of the canvas. Inside the tent the light came through the brown canvas. It smelled pleasantly of canvas. Already there was something mysterious and homelike. Nick was happy as he crawled inside the tent. He had not been unhappy all day. This was different though. Now things were done. There had been this to do. Now it was done. It had been a hard trip. He was very tired. That was done. He had made his camp. He was settled. Noth虹ng could touch him. It was a good place to camp. He was there, in the good place. He was in his home where he had made it. Now he was hungry.  He came out, crawling under the cheese cloth. It was quite dark outside. It was lighter in the tent.  Nick went over to the pack and found, with his fingers, a long nail in a paper sack of nails, in the bottom of the pack. He drove it into the pine tree, holding it close and hitting it gently with the flat of the ax. He hung the pack up on the nail. All his supplies were in the pack. They were off the ground and sheltered now.  Nick was hungry. He did not believe he had ever been hungrier. He opened and emptied a can of pork and beans and a can of spaghetti into the frying pan.  "I've got a right to eat this kind of stuff, if I'm willing to carry it," Nick said. His voice sounded strange in the darkening woods. He did not speak again.  He started a fire with some chunks of pine he got with the ax from a stump. Over the fire he stuck a wire grill, pushing the four legs down into the ground with his boot. Nick put the frying pan on the grill over the flames. He was hungrier. The beans and spaghetti warmed. Nick stirred them and mixed them together. They began to bubble, making little bubbles that rose with difficulty to the surface. There was a good smell. Nick got out a bottle of tomato catchup and cut four slices of bread. The little bubbles were coming faster now. Nick sat down beside the fire and lifted the frying pan off. He poured about half the contents out into the tin plate. It spread slowly on the plate. Nick knew it was too hot. He poured on some tomato catch赴p. He knew the beans and spaghetti were still too hot. He looked at the fire, then at the tent, he was not going to spoil it all by burning his tongue. For years he had never enjoyed fried bananas because he had never been able to wait for them to cool. His tongue was very sensitive. He was very hungry. Across the river in the swamp, in the almost dark, he saw a mist rising. He looked at the tent once more. All right. He took a full spoonful from the plate.  "Chrise," Nick said, "Geezus Chrise," he said happily.  He ate the whole plateful before he remem苑ered the bread. Nick finished the second plate苯ul with the bread, mopping the plate shiny. He had not eaten since a cup of coffee and a ham sandwich in the station restaurant at St. Ignace. It had been a very fine experience. He had been that hungry before, but had not been able to satisfy it. He could have made camp hours be苯ore if he had wanted to. There were plenty of good places to camp on the river. But this was good.  Nick tucked two big chips of pine under the grill. The fire flared up. He had forgotten to get water for the coffee. Out of the pack he got a folding canvas bucket and walked down the hill, across the edge of the meadow, to the stream. The other bank was in the white mist. The grass was wet and cold as he knelt on the bank and dipped the canvas bucket into the stream. It bellied and pulled hard in the cur訃ent. The water was ice cold. Nick rinsed the bucket and carried it full up to the camp. Up away from the stream it was not so cold.  Nick drove another big nail and hung up the bucket full of water. He dipped the coffee pot half full, put some more chips under the grill onto the fire and put the pot on. He could not remember which way he made coffee. He could remember an argument about it with Hopkins, but not which side he had taken. He decided to bring it to a boil. He remembered now that was Hopkins's way.	He had once argued about everything with Hopkins. While he waited for the coffee to boil, he opened a small can of apricots. He liked to open cans. He emptied the can of apricots out into a tin cup. While he watched the coffee on the fire, he drank the juice syrup of the apricots, carefully at first to keep from spilling, then meditatively, sucking the ap訃icots down. They were better than fresh apri苞ots.  The coffee boiled as he watched. The lid came up and coffee and grounds ran down the side of the pot. Nick took it off the grill. It was a triumph for Hopkins. He put sugar in the empty apricot cup and poured some of the coffee out to cool. It was too hot to pour and he used his hat to hold the handle of the coffee pot. He would not let it steep in the pot at all. Not the first cup. It should be straight Hopkins all the way. Hop deserved that. He was a very serious coffee maker. He was the most serious man Nick had ever known.	Not heavy, serious. That was a longtime ago.	Hopkins spoke with觔ut moving his lips. He had played polo. He made millions of dollars in Texas. He had bor訃owed carfare to go to Chicago, when the wire came that his first big well had come in. He could have wired for money. That would have been too slow. They called Hop's girl the Blonde Venus. Hop did not mind because she was not his real girl. Hopkins said very confi苓ently that none of them would make fun of his real girl. He was right. Hopkins went away when the telegram came. That was on the Black River. It took eight days for the telegram to reach him. Hopkins gave away his .22 caliber Colt automatic pistol to Nick. He gave his camera to Bill. It was to remember him always by. They were all going fishing again next sum衫er. The Hop Head was rich. He would get a yacht and they would all cruise along the north shore of Lake Superior. He was excited but serious. They said good-bye and all felt bad. It broke up the trip. They never saw Hopkins again. That was a long time ago on the Black River.  Nick drank the coffee, the coffee according to Hopkins. The coffee was bitter. Nick laughed. It made a good ending to the story. His mind was starting to work. He knew he could choke it because he was tired enough. He spilled the coffee out of the pot and shook the grounds loose into the fire. He lit a cigarette and went inside the tent. He took off his shoes and trousers, sitting on the blankets, rolled the shoes up inside the trousers for a pillow and got in between the blankets.  Out through the front of the tent he watched the glow of the fire, when the night wind blew on it. It was a quiet night. The swamp was perfectly quiet. Nick stretched under the blan虺et comfortably. A mosquito hummed close to his ear. Nick sat up and lit a match. The mos訂uito was on the canvas, over his head. Nick moved the match quickly up to it. The mosquito made a satisfactory hiss in the flame. The match went out. Nick lay down again under the blan虺ets. He turned on his side and shut his eyes. He was sleepy. He felt sleep coming. He curled up under the blanket and went to sleep.  They hanged Sam Cardinella at six o'clock in the morning in the corridor of the county jail. The corridor was high and narrow with tiers of cells on either side. All the cells were occupied. The prisoners had been brought in for the hanging. Five men sentenced to be hanged were in the five top cells. Three of the men to be hanged were negroes. They were very frightened. One of the white men sat on his cot with his head in his hands. The other lay flat on his cot with a blanket wrapped around his head.  They came out onto the gallows through a door in the wall. There were six or seven of them including two priests.They were carrying Sam Cardinella. He had been like that since about four o'clock in the morning.  While they were strapping his legs together two guards held him up and the two priests were whispering to him. "Be a man, my son," said one priest. When they came toward him with the cap to go over his head Sam Cardinella lost con負rol of his sphincter muscles.	The guards who had been holding him up dropped him. They were both disgusted. "How about a chair, Will?" asked one of the guards. "Better get one," said a man in a derby hat.  When they all stepped back on the scaffolding back of the drop, which was very heavy, built of oak and steel and swung on ball bearings, Sam Cardinella was left sitting there strapped tight with the rope around his neck, the younger of the two priests kneeling beside the chair holding up a little crucifix. The priest skipped back onto the scaffolding just before the drop fell.  In the morning the sun was up and the tent was starting to get hot. Nick crawled out under the mosquito netting stretched across the mouth of the tent, to look at the morning. The grass was wet on his hands as he came out. He held his trousers and his shoes in his hands. The sun was just up over the hill. There was the meadow, the river and the swamp. There were birch trees in the green of the swamp on the other side of the river.  The river was clear and smoothly fast in the early morning. Down about two hundred yards were three logs all the way across the stream. They made the water smooth and deep above them. As Nick watched, a mink crossed the river on the logs and went into the swamp. Nick was excited. He was excited by the early morn虹ng and the river. He was really too hurried to eat breakfast, but he knew he must. He built a little fire and put on the coffee pot. While the water was heating in the pot he took an empty bottle and went down over the edge of the high ground to the meadow. The meadow was wet with dew and Nick wanted to catch grasshoppers for bait before the sun dried the grass. He found plenty of good grasshoppers. They were at the base of the grass stems. Sometimes they clung to a grass stem. They were cold and wet with the dew, and could not jump until the sun warmed them. Nick picked them up, taking only the medium sized brown ones, and put them into the bottle. He turned over a log and just under the shelter of the edge were several hun苓red hoppers. It was a grasshopper lodging house. Nick put about fifty of the medium browns into the bottle. While he was picking up the hoppers the others warmed in the sun and commenced to hop away. They flew when they hopped. At first they made one flight and stayed stiff when they landed, as though they were dead.  Nick knew that by the time he was through with breakfast they would be as lively as ever. Without dew in the grass it would take him all day to catch a bottle full of good grasshoppers and he would have to crush many of them, slam衫ing at them with his hat. He washed his hands at the stream. He was excited to be near it. Then he walked up to the tent. The hoppers were already jumping stiffly in the grass. In the bottle, warmed by the sun, they were jumping in a mass. Nick put in a pine stick as a cork. It plugged the mouth of the bottle enough, so the hoppers could not get out and left plenty of air passage.  He had rolled the log back and knew he could get grasshoppers there every morning.  Nick laid the bottle full of jumping grass虐oppers against a pine trunk. Rapidly he mixed some buckwheat flour with water and stirred it smooth, one cup of flour, one cup of water. He put a handful of coffee in the pot and dipped a lump of grease out of a can and slid it sputtering across the hot skillet. On the smoking skillet he poured smoothly the buckwheat batter. It spread like lava, the grease spitting sharply. Around the edges the buckwheat cake began to firm, then brown, then crisp. The surface was bubbling slowly to porousness. Nick pushed under the browned under surface with a fresh pine chip. He shook the skillet sideways and the cake was loose on the surface. I won't try and flop it, he thought. He slid the chip of clean wood all the way under the cake, and flopped it over onto its face. It sputtered in the pan.  When it was cooked Nick regreased the skil衍et. He used all the batter. It made another big flapjack and one smaller one.  Nick ate a big flapjack and a smaller one, covered with apple butter. He put apple butter on the third cake, folded it over twice, wrapped it in oiled paper and put it in his shirt pocket. He put the apple butter jar back in the pack and cut bread for two sandwiches.  In the pack he found a big onion. He sliced it in two and peeled the silky outer skin. Then he cut one half into slices and made onion sand趴iches. He wrapped them in oiled paper and buttoned them in the other pocket of his khaki shirt. He turned the skillet upside down on the grill, drank the coffee, sweetened and yellow brown with the condensed milk in it, and tidied up the camp. It was a nice little camp.  Nick took his fly rod out of the leather rod苞ase, jointed it, and shoved the rod-case back into the tent. He put on the reel and threaded the line through the guides. He had to hold it from hand to hand, as he threaded it, or it would slip back through its own weight. It was a heavy, double tapered fly line. Nick had paid eight dollars for it a long time ago. It was made heavy to lift back in the air and come forward flat and heavy and straight to make it possible to cast a fly which has no weight. Nick opened the aluminum leader box. The leaders were coiled between the damp flannel pads. Nick had wet the pads at the water cooler on the train up to St. Ignace. In the damp pads the gut leaders had softened and Nick unrolled one and tied it by a loop at the end to the heavy fly line. He fastened a hook on the end of the leader. It was a small hook; very thin and springy.  Nick took it from his hook book, sitting with the rod across his lap. He tested the knot and the spring of the rod by pulling the line taut. It was a good feeling. He was careful not to let the hook bite into his finger.  He started down to the stream, holding his rod, the bottle of grasshoppers hung from his neck by a thong tied in half hitches around the neck of the bottle. His landing net hung by a hook from his belt. Over his shoulder was a long flour sack tied at each corner into an ear. The cord went over his shoulder. The sack flapped against his legs.  Nick felt awkward and professionally happy with all his equipment hanging from him. The grasshopper bottle swung against his chest. In his shirt the breast pockets bulged against him with the lunch and his fly book.  He stepped into the stream. It was a shock. His trousers clung tight to his legs. His shoes felt the gravel. The water was a rising cold shock.  Rushing, the current sucked against his legs. Where he stepped in, the water was over his knees. He waded with the current. The gravel slid under his shoes. He looked down at the swirl of water below each leg and tipped up the bottle to get a grasshopper.  The first grasshopper gave a jump in the neck of the bottle and went out into the water. He was sucked under in the whirl by Nick's right leg and came to the surface a little way down stream. He floated rapidly, kicking. In a quick circle, breaking the smooth surface of the water, he disappeared. A trout had taken him.  Another hopper poked his head out of the bottle. His antennæ wavered. He was getting his front legs out of the bottle to jump. Nick took him by the head and held him while he threaded the slim hook under his chin, down through his thorax and into the last segments of his abdomen. The grasshopper took hold of the hook with his front feet, spitting tobacco juice on it. Nick dropped him into the water.  Holding the rod in his right hand he let out line against the pull of the grasshopper in the current. He stripped off line from the reel with his left hand and let it run free. He could see the hopper in the little waves of the current. It went out of sight.  There was a tug on the line. Nick pulled against the taut line. It was his first strike. Holding the now living rod across the current, he brought in the line with his left hand. The rod bent in jerks, the trout pumping against the current. Nick knew it was a small one. He lifted the rod straight up in the air. It bowed with the pull.  He saw the trout in the water jerking with his head and body against the shifting tangent of the line in the stream.  Nick took the line in his left hand and pulled the trout, thumping tiredly against the current, to the surface. His back was mottled the clear, water-over-gravel color, his side flashing in the sun. The rod under his right arm, Nick stooped, dipping his right hand into the current. He held the trout, never still, with his moist right hand, while he unhooked the barb from his mouth, then dropped him back into the stream.  He hung unsteadily in the current, then settled to the bottom beside a stone. Nick reached down his hand to touch him, his arm to the elbow under water. The trout was steady in the mov虹ng stream, resting on the gravel, beside a stone. As Nick's fingers touched him, touched his smooth, cool, underwater feeling he was gone, gone in a shadow across the bottom of the stream.  He's all right, Nick thought. He was only tired.  He had wet his hand before he touched the trout, so he would not disturb the delicate mu苞us that covered him. If a trout was touched with a dry hand, a white fungus attacked the unprotected spot. Years before when he had fished crowded streams, with fly fishermen ahead of him and behind him, Nick had again and again come on dead trout, furry with white fun茆us, drifted against a rock, or floating belly up in some pool. Nick did not like to fish with other men on the river. Unless they were of your party, they spoiled it.  He wallowed down the stream, above his knees in the current, through the fifty yards of shallow water above the pile of logs that crossed the stream. He did not rebait his hook and held it in his hand as he waded. He was certain he could catch small trout in the shallows, but he did not want them. There would be no big trout in the shallows this time of day.  Now the water deepened up his thighs sharply and coldly. Ahead was the smooth dammed-back flood of water above the logs. The water was smooth and dark; on the left, the lower edge of the meadow; on the right the swamp.  Nick leaned back against the current and took a hopper from the bottle. He threaded the hop計er on the hook and spat on him for good luck. Then he pulled several yards of line from the reel and tossed the hopper out ahead onto the fast, dark water. It floated down towards the logs, then the weight of the line pulled the bait under the surface. Nick held the rod in his right hand, letting the line run out through his fingers.  There was a long tug. Nick struck and the rod came alive and dangerous, bent double, the line tightening, coming out of water, tightening, all in a heavy, dangerous, steady pull. Nick felt the moment when the leader would break if the strain increased and let the line go.  The reel ratcheted into a mechanical shriek as the line went out in a rush. Too fast. Nick could not check it, the line rushing out, the reel note rising as the line ran out.  With the core of the reel showing, his heart feeling stopped with the excitement, leaning back against the current that mounted icily his thighs, Nick thumbed the reel hard with his left hand. It was awkward getting his thumb inside the fly reel frame.  As he put on pressure the line tightened into sudden hardness and beyond the logs a huge trout went high out of water. As he jumped, Nick lowered the tip of the rod. But he felt, as he dropped the tip to ease the strain, the moment when the strain was too great; the hardness too tight. Of course, the leader had broken. There was no mistaking the feeling when all spring left the line and it became dry and hard. Then it went slack.  His mouth dry, his heart down, Nick reeled in. He had never seen so big a trout. There was a heaviness, a power not to be held, and then the bulk of him, as he jumped. He looked as broad as a salmon.  Nick's hand was shaky. He reeled in slowly. The thrill had been too much. He felt, vaguely, a little sick, as though it would be better to sit down.  The leader had broken where the hook was tied to it. Nick took it in his hand. He thought of the trout somewhere on the bottom, holding himself steady over the gravel, far down below the light, under the logs, with the hook in his jaw. Nick knew the trout's teeth would cut through the snell of the hook. The hook would imbed itself in his jaw. He'd bet the trout was angry. Anything that size would be angry. That was a trout. He had been solidly hooked. Solid as a rock. He felt like a rock, too, before he started off. By God, he was a big one. By God, he was the biggest one I ever heard of.  Nick climbed out onto the meadow and stood water running down his trousers and out of his shoes, his shoes squlchy. He went over and sat on the logs. He did not want to rush his sen貞ations any.  He wriggled his toes in the water, in his shoes, and got out a cigarette from his breast pocket. He lit it and tossed the match into the fast water below the logs. A tiny trout rose at the match, as it swung around in the fast current. Nick laughed. He would finish the cigarette.  He sat on the logs, smoking, drying in the sun, the sun warm on his back, the river shallow ahead entering the woods, curving into the woods, shallows, light glittering, big water貞mooth rocks, cedars along the bank and white birches, the logs warm in the sun, smooth to sit on, without bark, gray to the touch; slowly the feeling of disappointment left him. It went away slowly, the feeling of disappointment that came sharply after the thrill that made his shoul苓ers ache. It was all right now. His rod lying out on the logs, Nick tied a new hook on the leader, pulling the gut tight until it grimped into itself in a hard knot.  He baited up, then picked up the rod and walked to the far end of the logs to get into the water, where it was not too deep. Under and beyond the logs was a deep pool. Nick walked around the shallow shelf near the swamp shore until he came out on the shallow bed of the stream.  On the left, where the meadow ended and the woods began, a great elm tree was uprooted. Gone over in a storm, it lay back into the woods, its roots clotted with dirt, grass growing in them, rising a solid bank beside the stream. The river cut to the edge of the uprooted tree. From where Nick stood he could see deep channels, like ruts, cut in the shallow bed of the stream by the flow of the current. Pebbly where he stood and pebbly and full of boulders beyond; where it curved near the tree roots, the bed of the stream was marly and between the ruts of deep water green weed fronds swung in the current.  Nick swung the rod back over his shoulder and forward, and the line, curving forward, laid the grasshopper down on one of the deep chan要els in the weeds. A trout struck and Nick hooked him.  Holding the rod far out toward the uprooted tree and sloshing backward in the current, Nick worked the trout, plunging, the rod bending alive, out of the danger of the weeds into the open river. Holding the rod, pumping alive against the current, Nick brought the trout in. He rushed, but always came, the spring of the rod yielding to the rushes, sometimes jerking under water, but always bringing him in. Nick eased downstream with the rushes. The rod above his head he led the trout over the net, then lifted.  The trout hung heavy in the net, mottled trout back and silver sides in the meshes. Nick un虐ooked him; heavy sides, good to hold, big un苓ershot jaw, and slipped him, heaving and big sliding, into the long sack that hung from his shoulders in the water.  Nick spread the mouth of the sack against the current and it filled, heavy with water. He held it up, the bottom in the stream, and the water poured out through the sides. Inside at the bot負om was the big trout, alive in the water.  Nick moved downstream. The sack out ahead of him, sunk, heavy in the water, pulling from his shoulders.  It was getting hot, the sun hot on the back of his neck.  Nick had one good trout. He did not care about getting many trout. Now the stream was shallow and wide. There were trees along both banks. The trees of the left bank made short shadows on the current in the forenoon sun. Nick knew there were trout in each shadow. In the afternoon, after the sun had crossed to趴ard the hills, the trout would be in the cool shadows on the other side of the stream.  The very biggest ones would lie up close to the bank. You could always pick them up there on the Black. When the sun was down they all moved out into the current. Just when the sun made the water blinding in the glare before it went down, you were liable to strike a big trout anywhere in the current. It was almost impos貞ible to fish then, the surface of the water was blinding as a mirror in the sun. Of course, you could fish upstream, but in a stream like the Black, or this, you had to wallow against the current and in a deep place, the water piled up on you. It was no fun to fish upstream with this much current.  Nick moved along through the shallow stretch watching the banks for deep holes. A beech tree grew close beside the river, so that the branches hung down into the water. The stream went back in under the leaves. There were al趴ays trout in a place like that.  Nick did not care about fishing that hole. He was sure he would get hooked in the branches.  It looked deep though. He dropped the grass虐opper so the current took it under water, back in under the overhanging branch. The line pulled hard and Nick struck. The trout threshed heavily, half out of water in the leaves and branches. The line was caught. Nick pulled hard and the trout was off. He reeled in and holding the hook in his hand, walked down the stream.  Ahead, close to the left bank, was a big log. Nick saw it was hollow; pointing up river the current entered it smoothly, only a little ripple spread each side of the log. The water was deep苟ning. The top of the hollow log was gray and dry. It was partly in the shadow.  Nick took the cork out of the grasshopper bottle and a hopper clung to it. He picked him off, hooked him and tossed him out. He held the rod far out so that the hopper on the water moved into the current flowing into the hollow log. Nick lowered the rod and the hopper floated in. There was a heavy strike. Nick swung the rod against the pull. It felt as though he were hooked into the log itself, except for the live feeling.  He tried to force the fish out into the current. It came, heavily.  The line went slack and Nick thought the trout was gone. Then he saw him, very near, in the current, shaking his head, trying to get the hook out. His mouth was clamped shut. He was fighting the hook in the clear flowing cur訃ent.  Looping in the line with his left hand, Nick swung the rod to make the line taut and tried to lead the trout toward the net, but he was gone, out of sight, the line pumping. Nick fought him against the current, letting him thump in the water against the spring of the rod. He shifted the rod to his left hand, worked the trout up貞tream, holding his weight, fighting on the rod, and then let him down into the net. He lifted him clear of the water, a heavy half circle in the net, the net dripping, unhooked him and slid him into the sack.  He spread the mouth of the sack and looked down in at the two big trout alive in the water.  Through the deepening water, Nick waded over to the hollow log. He took the sack off, over his head, the trout flopping as it came out of water, and hung it so the trout were deep in the water. Then he pulled himself up on the log and sat, the water from his trousers and boots running down into the stream. He laid his rod down, moved along to the shady end of the log and took the sandwiches out of his pocket. He dipped the sandwiches in the cold water. The current carried away the crumbs. He ate the sandwiches and dipped his hat full of water to drink, the water running out through his hat just ahead of his drinking.  It was cool in the shade, sitting on the log. He took a cigarette out and struck a match to light it. The match sunk into the gray wood, making a tiny furrow. Nick leaned over the side of the log, found a hard place and lit the match. He sat smoking and watching the river.  Ahead the river narrowed and went into a swamp. The river became smooth and deep and the swamp looked solid with cedar trees, their trunks close together, their branches solid. If would not be possible to walk through a swamp like that. The branches grew so low. You would have to keep almost level with the ground to move at all. You could not crash through the branches. That must be why the animals that lived in swamps were built the way they were, Nick thought.  He wished he had brought something to read. He felt like reading. He did not feel like going on into the swamp. He looked down the river. A big cedar slanted all the way across the stream. Beyond that the river went into the swamp.  Nick did not want to go in there now. He felt a reaction against deep wading with the water deepening up under his armpits, to hook big trout in places impossible to land them. In the swamp the banks were bare, the big cedars came together overhead, the sun did not come through, except in patches; in the fast deep water, in the half light, the fishing would be tragic. In the swamp fishing was a tragic ad赳enture. Nick did not want it. He did not want to go down the stream any further today.  He took out his knife, opened it and stuck it in the log. Then he pulled up the sack, reached into it and brought out one of the trout. Hold虹ng him near the tail, hard to hold, alive, in his hand, he whacked him against the log. The trout quivered, rigid. Nick laid him on the log in the shade and broke the neck of the other fish the same way. He laid them side by side on the log. They were fine trout.  Nick cleaned them, slitting them from the vent to the tip of the jaw. All the insides and the gills and tongue came out in one piece. They were both males; long gray-white strips of milt, smooth and clean. All the insides clean and compact, coming out all together. Nick tossed the offal ashore for the minks to find.  He washed the trout in the stream. When he held them back up in the water they looked like live fish. Their color was not gone yet. He washed his hands and dried them on the log. Then he laid the trout on the sack spread out on the log, rolled them up in it, tied the bundle and put it in the landing net. His knife was still standing, blade stuck in the log. He cleaned it on the wood and put it in his pocket.  Nick stood up on the log, holding his rod, the landing net hanging heavy, then stepped into the water and splashed ashore. He climbed the bank and cut up into the woods, toward the high ground. He was going back to camp. He looked back. The river just showed through the trees. There were plenty of days coming when he could fish the swamp.  The first matador got the horn through his sword hand and the crowd hooted him out. The second matador slipped, and the bull caught him through the belly and he hung onto the horn with one hand and held the other tight against the place, and the bull rammed him wham against the barrier and the horn came out, and he lay in the sand, and then got up like crazy drunk and tried to slug the men carrying him away and yelled for his sword, but he fainted. The kid came out and had to kill five bulls because you can't have more than three matadors, and the last bull he was so tired he could hardly get the sword in. He could hardly lift his arm.	He tried five times and the crowd was quiet because it was a good bull and it looked like him or the bull and then he finally made it. He sat down in the sand and puked and they held a cape over him while the crowd hollered and threw things down into the bull ring.  Mr. and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby. They tried as often as Mrs. Elliot could stand it. They tried in Boston after they were married and they tried coming over on the boat. They did not try very often on the boat because Mrs. Elliot was quite sick. She was sick and when she was sick she was sick as Southern women are sick. That is women from the Southern part of the United States. Like all Southern women Mrs. Elliot disintegrated very quickly under sea sickness, travelling at night, and getting up too early in the morning. Many of the people on the boat took her for Elliot's mother. Other people who knew they were mar訃ied believed she was going to have a baby. In reality she was forty years old. Her years had been precipitated suddenly when she started travelling.  She had seemed much younger, in fact she had seemed not to have any age at all, when Elliot had married her after several weeks of making love to her after knowing her for a long time in her tea shop before he had kissed her one evening.  Hubert Elliot was taking post graduate work in law at Harvard when he was married. He was a poet with an income of nearly ten thousand dollars a year. He wrote very long poems very rapidly. He was twenty-five years old and had never gone to bed with a woman until he mar訃ied Mrs. Elliot. He wanted to keep himself pure so that he could bring to his wife the same purity of mind and body that he expected of her. He called it to himself living straight. He had been in love with various girls before he kissed Mrs. Elliot and always told them sooner or later that he had led a clean life. Nearly all the girls lost interest in him. He was shocked and really horrified at the way girls would become engaged to and marry men whom they must know had dragged themselves through the gutter. He once tried to warn a girl he knew against a man of whom he had almost proof that he had been a rotter at college and a very unpleasant incident had resulted.  Mrs. Elliot's name was Cornelia. She had taught him to call her Calutina, which was her family nickname in the South. His mother cried when he brought Cornelia home after their marriage but brightened very much when she learned they were going to live abroad.  Cornelia had said, "You dear sweet boy," and held him closer than ever when he had told her how he had kept himself clean for her. Cornelia was pure too. "Kiss me again like that," she said.  Hubert explained to her that he had learned that way of kissing from hearing a fellow tell a story once. He was delighted with his experi衫ent and they developed it as far as possible. Sometimes when they had been kissing together a long time, Cornelia would ask him to tell her again that he had kept himself really straight for her. The declaration always set her off again.  At first Hubert had no idea of marrying Cor要elia. He had never thought of her that way. She had been such a good friend of his, and then one day in the little back room of the shop they had been dancing to the gramophone while her girl friend was in the front of the shop and she had looked up into his eyes and he had kissed her. He could never remember just when it was decided that they were to be married. But they were married.  They spent the night of the day they were married in a Boston hotel. They were both disappointed but finally Cornelia went to sleep. Hubert could not sleep and several times went out and walked up and down the corridor of the hotel in his new Jaeger bathrobe that he had bought for his wedding trip. As he walked he saw all the pairs of shoes, small shoes and big shoes, outside the doors of the hotel rooms. This set his heart to pounding and he hurried back to his own room but Cornelia was asleep. He did not like to waken her and soon everything was quite all right and he slept peacefully.  The next day they called on his mother and the next day they sailed for Europe. It was possible to try to have a baby but Cornelia could not attempt it very often although they wanted a baby more than anything else in the world. They landed at Cherbourg and came to Paris. They tried to have a baby in Paris. Then they decided to go to Dijon where there was summer school and where a number of people who crossed on the boat with them had gone. They found there was nothing to do in Dijon. Hubert, however, was writing a great number of poems and Cornelia typed them for him. They were all very long poems. He was very severe about mistakes and would make her re-do an entire page if there was one mistake. She cried a good deal and they tried several times to have a baby before they left Dijon.  They came to Paris and most of their friends from the boat came back too. They were tired of Dijon and anyway would now be able to say that after leaving Harvard or Columbia or Wabash they had studied at the University of Dijon down in the Côte d'Or. Many of them would have preferred to go to Languedoc, Mont計ellier or Perpignan if there are universities there. But all those places are too far away. Dijon is only four and a half hours from Paris and there is a diner on the train.  So they all sat around the Café du Dome, avoiding the Rotonde across the street because it is always so full of foreigners, for a few days and then the Elliots rented a château in Tou訃aine through an advertisement in the New York Herald. Elliot had a number of friends by now all of whom admired his poetry and Mrs. Elliot had prevailed upon him to send over to Boston for her girl friend who had been in the tea shop. Mrs. Elliot became much brighter after her girl friend came and they had many good cries together. The girl friend was several years older than Cornelia and called her Honey. She too came from a very old Southern family.  The three of them, with several of Elliot's friends who called him Hubie, went down to the château in Touraine. They found Touraine to be a very flat hot country very much like Kansas. Elliot had nearly enough poems for a book now. He was going to bring it out in Boston and had already sent his check to, and made a contract with, a publisher.  In a short time the friends began to drift back to Paris. Touraine had not turned out the way it looked when it started. Soon all the friends had gone off with a rich young and unmarried poet to a seaside resort near Trouville. There they were all very happy.  Elliot kept on at the château in Touraine be苞ause he had taken it for all summer. He and Mrs. Elliot tried very hard to have a baby in the big hot bedroom on the big, hard bed. Mrs. Elliot was learning the touch system on the typewriter, but she found that while it increased the speed it made more mistakes. The girl friend was now typing practically all of the manuscripts. She was very neat and efficient and seemed to enjoy it. Elliot had taken to drinking white wine and lived apart in his own room. He wrote a great deal of poetry during the night and in the morning looked very exhausted. Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend now slept together in the big mediaeval bed. They had many a good cry together. In the evening they all sat at dinner together in the garden under a plane tree and the hot evening wind blew and Elliot drank white wine and Mrs. Elliot and the girl friend made conversation and they were all quite happy.
It is too soon to write about the Jazz Age with perspective, and without being suspected of premature arteriosclerosis. Many people still succumb to Violent retching when they happen upon any of its characteristic words—words which have since yielded in Vividness to the coinages of the underworld. It is as dead as were the Yellow Nineties in 1902. Yet the present writer already looks back to it with nostalgia. It bore him up, flattered him and gave him more money than he had dreamed of, simply for telling people that he felt as they did, that something had to be done with all the nervous energy stored up and unexpended in the War.  The ten—year period that, as if reluctant to die outmoded in its bed, leaped to a spectacular death in October, 1929, began about the time of the May Day riots in 1919. When the police rode down the demobilized country boys gaping at the orators in Madison Square, it was the sort of measure bound to alienate the more intelligent young men from the prevailing order. We didn’t remember anything about the Bill of Rights until Mencken began plugging it, but we did know that such tyranny belonged in the jittery little countries of South Europe. If goose—livered business men had this effect on the government, then maybe we had gone to war for]. P. Morgan’s loans after all. But, because we were tired of Great Causes, there was no more than a short outbreak of moral indignation, typified by Dos Passos’ Three Sodiem. Presently we began to have slices of the national cake and our idealism only flared up when the newspapers made melodrama out of such stories as Harding and the Ohio Gang or Sacco and Vanzetti. The events of 1919 left us cynical rather than revolutionary, in spite of the fact that now we are all rummaging around in our trunks wondering where in hell we left the liberty cap—“I know I had it”—and the moujik blouse. It was characteristic of the Jazz Age that it had no interest in politics at all. It was an age of miracles, it was an age of art, it was an age of excess, and it was an age of satire. A Stuffed Shirt, squirming to blackmail in a lifelike way, sat upon the throne of the United States; a stylish young man hurried over to represent to us the throne of England. A world of girls yearned for the young Englishman; the old American groaned in his sleep as he waited to be poisoned by his wife, upon the advice of the female Rasputin who then made the ultimate decision in our national affairs. But such matters apart, we had things our way at last. With Americans ordering suits by the gross in London, the Bond Street tailors perforce agreed to moderate their cut to the American long—waisted figure and loose—fitting taste, something subtle passed to America, the style of man. During the Renaissance, Francis the First looked to Florence to trim his leg. Seventeenth—century England aped the court of France, and fifty years ago the German Guards officer bought his civilian clothes in London. Gentlemen’s clothes—symbol of “the power that man must hold and that passes from race to race.”  We were the most powerful nation. Who could tell us any longer what was fashionable and what was fun? Isolated during the European War, we had begun combing the unknown South and West for folkways and pastimes, and there were more ready to hand.  The first social revelation created a sensation out of all proportion to its novelty. As far back as 1915 the unchaperoned young people of the smaller cities had discovered the mobile privacy of that automobile given to young Bill at sixteen to make him “self—reliant.” At first petting was a desperate adventure even under such favorable conditions, but presently confidences were exchanged and the old commandment broke down. As early as 1917 there were references to such sweet and casual dalliance in any number of the Y ale Record or the Princeton Tiger.  But petting in its more audacious manifestations was confined to the wealthier classes—among other young people the old standard prevailed until after the War, and a kiss meant that a proposal was expected, as young officers in strange cities sometimes discovered to their dismay. Only in 1920 did the veil finally fall—the Jazz Age was in flower.  Scarcely had the staider citizens of the republic caught their breaths when the wildest of all generations, the generation which had been adolescent during the confusion of the War, brusquely shouldered my contemporaries out of the way and danced into the limelight. This was the generation whose girls dramatized themselves as flappers, the generation that corrupted its elders and eventually overreached itself less through lack of morals than through lack of taste. May one offer in exhibit the year 1922! That was the peak of the younger generation, for though the Jazz Age continued, it became less and less an affair of youth.  The sequel was like a children’s party taken over by the elders, leaving the children puzzled and rather neglected and rather taken aback. By 1923 their elders, tired of watching the carnival with illconcealed envy, had discovered that young liquor will take the place of young blood, and with a whoop the orgy began. The younger generation was starred no longer.  A whole race going hedonistic, deciding on pleasure. The precocious intimacies of the younger generation would have come about with or without prohibition—they were implicit in the attempt to adapt English customs to American conditions. (Our South, for example, is tropical and early maturing—it has never been part of the wisdom of France and Spain to let young girls go unchaperoned at sixteen and seventeen.) But the general decision to be amused that began with the cocktail parties of 1921 had more complicated origins.  The word jazz in its progress toward respectability has meant first sex, then dancing, then music. It is associated with a state of nervous stimulation, not unlike that of big cities behind the lines of a war. To many English the War still goes on because all the forces that menace them are still active—Wherefore eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die. But different causes had now brought about a corresponding state in America—though there were entire classes (people over fifty, for example) who spent a whole decade denying its existence even when its puckish face peered into the family circle. Never did they dream that they had contributed to it. The honest citizens of every class, who believed in a strict public morality and were powerful enough to enforce the necessary legislation, did not know that they would necessarily be served by criminals and quacks, and do not really believe it to—day. Rich righteousness had always been able to buy honest and intelligent servants to free the slaves or the Cubans, so when this attempt collapsed our elders stood firm with all the stubbornness of people involved in a weak case, preserving their righteousness and losing their children. Silver—haired women and men with fine old faces, people who never did a consciously dishonest thing in their lives, still assure each other in the apartment hotels of New York and Boston and Washington that “there’s a whole generation growing up that will never know the taste of liquor.” Meanwhile their granddaughters pass the well—thumbed copy of Lady Chatterley} Lover around the boardingschool and, if they get about at all, know the taste of gin or corn at sixteen. But the generation who reached maturity between 1875 and 1895 continue to believe what they want to believe.  Even the intervening generations were incredulous. In 1920 Heywood Broun announced that all this hubbub was nonsense, that young men didn’t kiss but told anyhow. But very shortly people over twenty five came in for an intensive education. Let me trace some of the revelations vouchsafed them by reference to a dozen works written for various types of mentality during the decade. We begin with the suggestion that Don Juan leads an interesting life; then we learn that there’s a lot of sex around if we only knew it that adolescents lead very amorous lives, that there are a lot of neglected Anglo—Saxon words, that older people don’t always resist sudden temptations, that girls are sometimes seduced without being ruined, that even rape often turns out well, that glamorous English ladies are often promiscuous, that in fact they devote most of their time to it, that it’s a damn good thing too, and finally that there are abnormal variations.  In my opinion the erotic element in these works, even The Sheik written for children in the key of Peter Rabbit, did not one particle of harm. Everything they described, and much more, was familiar in our contemporary life. The majority of the theses were honest and elucidating—their effect was to restore some dignity to the male as opposed to the he—man in American life. (“And what is a ‘He—man’?” demanded Gertrude Stein one day. “Isn’t it a large enough order to fill out to the dimensions of all that ‘a man’ has meant in the past? A ‘He—man’l”)  The married woman can now discover whether she is being cheated, or whether sex is just something to be endured, and her compensation should be to establish a tyranny of the spirit, as her mother may have hinted. Perhaps many women found that love was meant to be fun. Anyhow the objectors lost their tawdry little case, which is one reason why our literature is now the most living in the world.  Contrary to popular opinion, the movies of the Jazz Age had no effect upon its morals. The social attitude of the producers was timid, behind the times and banal—for example, no picture mirrored even faintly the younger generation until 1923, when magazines had already been started to celebrate it and it had long ceased to be news. There were a few feeble splutters and then Clara Bow in Flaming Y outb,‘ promptly the Hollywood hacks ran the theme into its cinematographic grave. Throughout the Jazz Age the movies got no farther than Mrs. Jiggs, keeping up with its most blatant superficialities. This was no doubt due to the censorship as well as to innate conditions in the industry. In any case, the Jazz Age now raced along under its own power, served by great filling stations full of money.  The people over thirty, the people all the way up to fifty, had joined the dance. We graybeards (to tread down F. P. A.) remember the uproar when in 1912 grandmothers of forty tossed away their crutches and took lessons in the Tango and the Castle—Walk. A dozen years later a woman might pack the Green Hat with her other affairs as she set off for Europe or New York, but Savonarola was too busy flogging dead horses in Augean stables of his own creation to notice. Society, even in small cities, now dined in separate chambers, and the sober table learned about the gay table only from hearsay. There were very few people left at the sober table. One of its former glories, the less sought—after girls who had become resigned to sublimating a probable celibacy, came across Freud and Jung in seeking their intellectual recompense and came tearing back into the fray.  By 1926 the universal preoccupation with sex had become a nuisance. (I remember a perfectly mated, contented young mother asking my wife’s advice about “having an affair right away,” though she had no one especially in mind, “because don’t you think it’s sort of undignified when you get much over thirty?”) For a while bootleg Negro records with their phallic euphemisms made everything suggestive, and simultaneously came a wave of erotic plays—young girls from finishing—schools packed the galleries to hear about the romance of being a Lesbian and George Jean Nathan protested. Then one young producer lost his head entirely, drank a beauty’s alcoholic bath—water and went to the penitentiary. Somehow his pathetic attempt at romance belongs to the Jazz Age, while his contemporary in prison, Ruth Snyder, had to be hoisted into it by the tabloids—she was, as The Daily Newy hinted deliciously to gourmets, about “to cook, emd fizzle, AND FRY!” in the electric chair.  The gay elements of society had divided into two main streams, one flowing towards Palm Beach and DeauVille, and the other, much smaller, towards the summer Riviera. One could get away with more on the summer Riviera, and whatever happened seemed to have something to do with art. From 1926 to 1929, the great years of the Cap d’Antibes, this corner of France was dominated by a group quite distinct from that American society which is dominated by Europeans. Pretty much of anything went at Antibes—by 1929, at the most gorgeous paradise for swimmers on the Mediterranean no one swam any more, save for a short hang—over dip at noon. There was a picturesque graduation of steep rocks over the sea and somebody’s valet and an occasional English girl used to dive from them, but the Americans were content to discuss each other in the bar. This was indicative of something that was taking place in the homeland—Americans were getting soft. There were signs everywhere: we still won the Olympic games but with champions whose names had few vowels in themteams composed, like the fighting Irish combination of Notre Dame, of fresh overseas blood. Once the French became really interested, the Davis Cup gravitated automatically to their intensity in competition. The vacant lots of the NIiddle—Western cities were built up nowexcept for a short period in school, we were not turning out to be an athletic people like the British, after all. The hare and the tortoise. Of course if we wanted to we could be in a minute; we still had all those reserves of ancestral Vitality, but one day in 1926 we looked down and found we had flabby arms and a fat pot and couldn’t say boop—boop—a-doop to a Sicilian. Shades of Van Bibberl—no Utopian ideal, God  knows. Even golf, once considered an effeminate game, had seemed very strenuous of late—an emasculated form appeared and proved just right.  By 1927 a wide—spread neurosis began to be evident, faintly signalled, like a nervous beating of the feet, by the popularity of crossword puzzles. I remember a fellow expatriate opening a letter from a mutual friend of ours, urging him to come home and be revitalized by the hardy, bracing qualities of the native soil. It was a strong letter and it affected us both deeply, until we noticed that it was headed from a nerve sanatorium in Pennsylvania.  By this time contemporaries of mine had begun to disappear into the dark maw of Violence. A classmate killed his wife and himself on Long Island, another tumbled “accidently” from a skyscraper in Philadelphia, another purposely from a skyscraper in New York. One was killed in a speak—easy in Chicago; another was beaten to death in a speak—easy in New York and crawled home to the Princeton Club to die; still another had his skull crushed by a maniac’s axe in an insane asylum where he was confined. These are not catastrophes that I went out of my way to look for—these were my friends; moreover, these things happened not during the depression but during the boom.  In the spring of ’27, something bright and alien flashed across the sky. A young Minnesotan who seemed to have had nothing to do with his generation did a heroic thing, and for a moment people set down their glasses in country clubs and speak—easies and thought of their old best dreams. Maybe there was a way out by flying, maybe our restless blood could find frontiers in the illimitable air. But by that time we were all pretty well committed; and the Jazz Age continued; we would all have one more.  Nevertheless, Americans were wandering ever more widely – friends seemed eternally bound for Russia, Persia, Abyssinia, and Central Africa. And by 1928 Paris had grown suffocating. With each new shipment of Americans spewed up by the boom the quality fell off, until towards the end there was something sinister about the crazy boatloads. They were no longer the simple pa and ma and son and daughter, infinitely superior in their qualities of kindness and curiosity to the corresponding class in Europe, but fantastic neanderthals who believed something, something vague, that you remembered from a very cheap novel. I remember an Italian on a steamer who promenaded the deck in an American Reserve Officer’s uniform picking quarrels in broken English with Americans who criticized their own institutions in the bar. I remember a fat Jewess, inlaid with diamonds, who sat behind us at the Russian ballet and said as the curtain rose, “Thad’s luffly, dey ought to baint a bicture of it.” This was low comedy, but it was evident that money and power were falling into the hands of people in comparison with whom the leader of a Village Soviet would be a gold—mine of judgment and culture. There were citizens travelling in luxury in 1928 and 1929, who, in the distortion of their new condition, had the human value of Pekinese, bivalves, cretins, goats. I remember the Judge from some New York district who had taken his daughter to see the Bayeux Tapestries and made a scene in the papers advocating their segregation because one scene was immoral. But in those days life was like the race in Alice in Wonderland, there was a prize for every one.  The Jazz Age had had a wild youth and a heady middle age. There was the phase of the necking parties, the Leopold—Loeb murder (I remember the time my wife was arrested on Queensborough Bridge on the suspicion of being the “Bob—haired Bandit”) and the John Held Clothes. In the second phase such phenomena as sex and murder became more mature, if much more conventional. Middle age must be served and pajamas came to the beach to save fat thighs and flabby calves from competition with the one—piece bathing—suit. Finally skirts came down and everything was concealed. Everybody was at scratch now. Let’s go But it was not to be. Somebody had blundered and the most expensive orgy in history was over.  It ended two years ago [1929], because the utter confidence which was its essential prop received an enormous jolt, and it didn’t take long for the flimsy structure to settle earthward. And after two years the Jazz Age seems as far away as the days before the War. It was borrowed time anyhow—the whole upper tenth of a nation living with the insouciance of grand dukes and the casualness of chorus girls. But moralizing is easy now and it was pleasant to be in one’s twenties in such a certain and unworried time. Even when you were broke you didn’t worry about money, because it was in such profusion around you. Towards the end one had a struggle to pay one’s share; it was almost a favor to accept hospitality that required any travelling. Charm, notoriety, mere good manners weighed more than money as a social asset. This was rather splendid, but things were getting thinner and thinner as the eternal necessary human values tried to spread over all that expansion. Writers were geniuses on the strength of one respectable book or play; just as during the War officers of four months’ experience commanded hundreds of men, so there were now many little fish lording it over great big bowls. In the theatrical world extravagant productions were carried by a few second—rate stars, and so on up the scale into politics, where it was difficult to interest good men in positions of the highest importance and responsibility, importance and responsibility far exceeding that of business executives but which paid only five or six thousand a year.  Now once more the belt is tight and we summon the proper expression of horror as we look back at our wasted youth. Sometimes, though, there is a ghostly rumble among the drums, an asthmatic whisper in the trombones that swings me back into the early twenties when we drank wood alcohol and every day in every way grew better and better, and there was a first abortive shortening of the skirts, and girls all looked alike in sweater dresses, and people you didn’t want to know said “Yes, we have no bananas,” and it seemed only a question of a few years before the older people would step aside and let the world be run by those who saw things as they were—and it all seems rosy and romantic to us who were young then, because we will never feel quite so intensely about our surroundings any more.
Twenty years ago, a celebration happened the celebration of Krazy Kat by Gilbert Seldes. It happened in a book called The Seven Lively Arts; and it happened so wisely, so lovingly, so joyously, that recelebrating Krazy would be like teaching penguins to fly. Penguins (as a lot of people don't realize) do fly not through the sea of the sky but through the sky of the sea – and my present ambition is merely, with our celebrated friend's assistance, to show how their flying affects every nonpenguin. What concerns me fundamentally is a meteoric but less melodrama, born of the immemorial adage love will find a way. This frank frenzy (encouraged by a strictly irrational landscape in perpetual metamorphosis) generates three protagonists and a plot. Two of the protagonists are easily recognized as a cynical brick throwing mouse and a sentimental policeman-dog. The third protagonist – whose ambiguous gender doesn't disguise the good news that here comes our heroine – may be described as a humbly poetic, gently clownlike, supremely innocent, and illimitably affectionate creature (slightly ressembling a child's drawing of a cat, but gifted with the secret grace and obvious clumsiness of a penguin on terra firma) who is never so happy as when egoist mouse, thwarting altruist-dog, hits her in the head with a brick. Dog hates mouse and worships "cat," mouse despises "cat" and hates dog, "cat" hates noone and loves mouse. Ignatz Mouse and Offisa Pup are opposite sides of the same coin. Is Offisa Pup kind –  Only in so far as Ignatz Mouse is cruel. If you're a two fisted spineless progressive (a mighty lrThe introduction to a book of comic strips by George Herriman, to be published by Henry Holt  fashionable stance nowadays) Offisa Pup, who forcefully asserts  the will of so called society, becomes a cosmic angel; while Ignatz  Mouse, who forcefully defies society's so called will by asserting  his authentic own, becomes a demon of anarchy and a fiend of  chaos. But if – whisper it – you're a 100% hidebound reactionary, the foot's in the other shoe. Ignatz Mouse then stands  forth as a hero, pluckily struggling to keep the flag of free-will  flying; while Offisa Pup assumes the monstrous mien of a Goliath,  satanically bullying a tiny but indomitable David. Well, let's  flip the coin – so: and lo! Offisa Pup comes up. That makes  Ignatz Mouse "tails". Now we have a hero whose heart has  gone to his head and a villain whose head has gone to his heart.  This hero and this villain no more understand Krazy Kat than  the mythical denizens of a two dimensional realm understand some  three dimensional intruder. The world of Offisa Pup and Ignatz  Mouse is a knowledgeable power-world, in terms of which our  unknowledgeable heroine is powerlessness personified. The sensical law of this world is might makes right-, the nonsensical law  of our heroine is love conquers all. To put the oak in the acorn:  Ignatz Mouse and Offisa Pup (each completely convinced that  his own particular brand of might makes right) are simple  minded – Krazy isn't – therefore, to Offisa Pup and Ignatz  Mouse, Krazy is. But if both our hero and our villain don't  and can't understand our heroine, each of them can and each  of them does misunderstand her differently. To our softheaded  altruist, she is the adorably helpless incarnation of saintliness. To  our hardhearted egoist, she is the puzzlingly indestructible embodiment of idiocy. The benevolent overdog sees her as an  inspired weakling. The malevolent undermouse views her as  a born target. Meanwhile Krazy Kat, through this double misunderstanding, fulfills her joyous destiny.  Let's make no mistake about Krazy. A lot of people "love"  because, and a lot of people "love" although, and a few individuals love. Love is something illimitable; and a lot of people spend   d their limited lives trying to prevent anything illimitable  from happening to them. Krazy, however, is not a lot of people.  Krazy is herself. Krazy is illimitable – she loves. She loves  in the only way anyone can love: illimitably. She isn't morbid  and she isn't long suffering; she doesn't "love" someone because  he hurts her and she doesn't "love" someone although he hurts  her. She doesn't, moreover, "love" someone who hurts her.  Quite the contrary: she loves someone who gives her unmitigated  joy. How –  By always trying his limited worst to make her  unlove him, and always failing – not that our heroine is insensitive (for a more sensitive heroine never existed) but that our  villain's every effort to limit her love with his unlove ends by a  transforming of his limitation into her illimitability. If you're  going to pity anyone, the last anyone to pity is our loving heroine,  Krazy Kat. You might better pity that doggedly idolatrous  imbecile, our hero; who policeman fully strives to protect his  idol from catastrophic desecration at the paws of our iconoclastic  villain – never suspecting that this very desecration becomes,  through our transcending heroine, a consecration; and that this  consecration reveals the ultimate meaning of existence. But the  person to really pity (if really pity you must) is Ignatz. Poor  villain! All his malevolence turns to beneficence at contact with  Krazy's head. By profaning the temple of altruism, alias law  and order, he worships (entirely against his will) at the shrine of  love.  I repeat: let's make no mistake about Krazy. Her helplessness,  as we have just seen, is merely sensical – nonsensically she's a  triumphant, not to say invincible, phenomenon. As for this in  vincible phenomenon's supposed idiocy, it doesn't even begin  to fool nonsensical you and me. Life, to a lot of people, means  either the triumph of mind over matter or the triumph of matter  over mind; but you and I aren't a lot of people. We understand  that, just as there is something – love – infinitely more significant  than brute force, there is something – wisdom – infinitely more   significant than mental prowess. A remarkably developed intelligence impresses us about as much as a sixteen inch biceps. If  we know anything, we know that a lot of people can learn knowledge (which is the same thing as unlearning ignorance) but that  none can learn wisdom. Wisdom, like love, is a spiritual gift.  And Krazy happens to be extraordinarily gifted. She has not  only the gift of love, but the gift of wisdom as well. Her un  knowledgeable wisdom blossoms in almost every episode of our  meteoric burlesk melodrama; the supreme blossom, perhaps,  being a tribute to Offisa Pup and Ignatz Mouse – who (as she  observes) are playing a little game together. Right! The game  they're playing, willy nilly, is the exciting democratic game of  cat loves mouse-, the game which a lot of highly moral people  all over the so called world consider uncivilized. I refer (of  course) to those red-brown-and-blackshirted Puritans who want  us all to scrap democracy and adopt their modernized version of  follow the leader – a strictly ultra progressive and super benevolent  affair which begins with the liquidation of Ignatz Mouse by Offisa  Pup. But (objects Krazy, in her innocent democratic way)  Ignatz Mouse and Offisa Pup are having fun. Right again!  And – from the Puritan point of view – nothing could be worse.  Fun, to Puritans, is something wicked: an invention of The Devil  Himself. That's why all these super benevolent collectivists are  so hyper spinelessly keen on having us play their ultra progressive  game. The first super benevolent rule of their ultra progressive  game is thou shah not flay.  If only the devilish game of democracy were exclusively concerned with such mindful matters as ignorance and knowledge,  crime and punishment, cruelty and kindness, collectivists would  really have something on the ball. But it so happens that democracy involves the spiritual values of wisdom, love, and joy.  Democracy isn't democracy because or although Ignatz Mouse  and Offisa Pup are fighting a peaceful war. Democracy is democracy in so far as our villain and our hero –   fun, by playing their brutal little game – happen (despite their worst and best efforts) to be fulfilling our heroine's immeasurable destiny. Joy is her destiny: and joy comes through Ignatz – via Offisa Pup; since it's our villain's loathing for law which gives him the strength of ten when he hurls his bliss yielding brick. Let's not forget that. And let's be perfectly sure about something else. Even if Offisa Pup should go crazy and start chasing Krazy, and even if Krazy should go crazy and start chasing Ignatz, and even if crazy Krazy should swallow crazy Ignatz and crazy Offisa Pup should swallow crazy Krazy and it was the millenium – there'd still be the brick. And (having noth ing else to swallow) Offisa Pup would then swallow the brick. Whereupon, as the brick hit Krazy, Krazy would be happy. Alas for sensical reformers! Never can they realize that penguins do fly; that Krazy's idiocy and helplessness in terms of a world – any world – are as nothing to the Nth power, by comparison with a world's – any world's – helplessness and idiocy in terms of Krazy. Yet the truth of truths lies here and no where else. Always (no matter what's real) Krazy is no mere reality. She is a living ideal. She is a spiritual force, inhabiting a merely real world – and the realer a merely real world hap pens to be, the more this living ideal becomes herself. Hence  – needless to add – the brick. Only if, and whenever, that kind reality (cruelly wielded by our heroic villain, Ignatz Mouse, in despite of our villainous hero, Offisa Pup) smites Krazy – fairly and squarely – does the joyous symbol of Love Fulfilled appear above our triumphantly unknowledgeable heroine. And now do we understand the meaning of democracy –  If we don't, a poet-painter called George Herriman most certainly cannot be blamed. Democracy, he tells us again and again and again, isn't some ultra progressive myth of a super benevolent World As Should Be. The meteoric burlesk melodrama of democracy is a struggle bet wen society (Offisa Pup) and the individual (Ignatz Mouse) over an ideal (our heroine) – a struggle from  which, again and again and again, emerges one stupendous fact; namely, that the ideal of democracy fulfills herself only if, and whenever, society fails to suppress the individual. Could anything possibly be clearer – Nothing-unless it's the kindred fact that our illimitably affectionate Krazy has no connection with the old fashioned heroine of common or garden melodrama. That prosaically "virtuous" puppet couldn't bat a decorously "innocent" eyelash without immediately provoking some utterly estimable Mr. Righto to liquidate some perfectly wicked Mr. Wrongo. In her hyper spineless puritanical simplicity, she desired nothing quite so much as an ultra progressive and super benevolent substitute for human nature. Democracy's merciful leading lady, on the other hand, is a fundamentally complex being who demands the whole mystery of life. Krazy Kat – who, with every mangled word and murdered gesture, translates a mangling and murdering world into Peace And Good Will – is the only original and authentic revolutionary protagonist. All blood-and-thunder Worlds As Should Be can not comprise this immeasurably generous heroine of the strictly unmitigated future. She has no fear – even of a mouse.  Perhaps a few individuals may enjoy my pictures. Possibly a few may enjoy my poems.  And if yes, what could be better?  Equidistant from such wonderful luck – with a distance not reckonable by mere lightyears – are the naying and the yeaing of numberless televisionary unindividuals: movieloving each blinder than radioactive any is deaf.  Were I a critic, should probably add that "academic" (i.e. un-) art resembles every good coin, which it isn't, in having two sides. One side can be called "photographic realism" or even "naturalism"; the other, "nonrepresentational" or "abstract" sic "painting." And your stupid wiseguy doing his worst to deny Nature equals your clever fool who did his best to possess her.  Of all the lively arts the Comic Strip is the most despised, and with the exception of the movies it is the most popular. Some twenty million people follow with interest, curiosity, and amusement the daily fortunes of five or ten heroes of the comic strip, and that they do this is considered by all those who have any pretentions to taste and culture as a symptom of crass vulgarity, of dulness, and, for all I know, of defeated and inhibited lives. I need hardly add that those who feel so about the comic strip only infrequently regard the object of their distaste.  Certainly there is a great deal of monotonous stupidity in the comic strip, a cheap jocosity, a life-of-the-party humour which is extraordinarily dreary. There is also a quantity of bad drawing and the intellectual level, if that matters, is sometimes not high. Yet we are not actually a dull people; we take our fun where we find it, and we have an exceptional capacity for liking the things which show us off in ridiculous postures--a counterpart to our inveterate passion for seeing ourselves in stained-glass attitudes. And the fact that we do care for the comic strip that Jiggs and Mutt-and-Jeff and Skinnay and the Gumps have entered into our existence as definitely as Roosevelt and more deeply than Pickwick-ought to make them worth looking at, for once. Certainly they would have been more sharply regarded if they had produced the counterpart of Chaplin in the comic film--a universal genius capable of holding the multitude  and exciting the speculations of the intellectuals. It happens that the actual genius of the comic strip, George Herriman, is of such a special sort that even when he is recognized he is considered something apart and his appearance among other strips is held to be only an accident.  It is by no means an accident, for the comic strip is an exceptionally supple medium, giving play to a variety of talents, to the use of many methods, and it adapts itself to almost any theme. The enormous circulation it achieves imposes certain limitations: it cannot be too local, since it is syndicated throughout the country; it must avoid political and social questions because the same strip appears in papers of divergent editorial opinions; there is no room in it for acute racial caricature, although no group is immune from its mockery. These and other restrictions have gradually made of the comic strip a changing picture of the average American life-and by compensation it provides us with the freest American fantasy.  In a book which appeared about two years ago, Civilization in the United States, thirty Americans rendered account of our present state. One of them, and one only, mentioned the comic strip--Mr Harold E. Stearns--and he summed up the "intellectual" attitude perfectly by saying that Bringing Up Father will repay the social historian for all the attention he gives it. I do not know in what satisfactions the social historian can be repaid. I fear that the actual   fun in the comic strip is not one of them. Bringing Up Father, says Mr Stearns, "symbolizes better than most of us appreciate the normal relation of American men and women to cultural and intellectual values. Its very grotesqueness and vulgarity are revealing" (italics mine). (Query: Is it vulgar of Jiggs to prefer Dinty's cafe to a Swami's lecture 1 Or of Mrs Jiggs to insist on the lecture! Or of both of them to be rather free in the matter of using vases as projectiles? What, in short, is vulgar?) I am far from quarreling with Mr Stearns' leading idea, for I am sure that a history of manners in the United States could be composed with the comic strip as its golden thread; but I think that something more than its vulgarity would be revealing.  The daily comic strip arrived in the early nine ties-perhaps it was our contribution to that artistic age-and has gone through several phases. In 1892 or thereabouts Jimmy Swinnerton created Little Bears and Tigers for the San Francisco Examiner; that forerunner has passed away, but Swinnerton remains, and everything he does is observed with respect by the other comic-strip artists; he has had more influence on the strip even than Wilhelm Busch, the German whose Max und Moritz were undoubt edly the originals of the Katzenjammer Kids. The strip worked its way east, prospered by William Randolph Hearst especially in the coloured Sunday Supplement, and as a daily feature by the Chicago   Daily News, which was, I am informed, the first to syndicate its strips and so enabled Americans to think nationally. About fifteen years ago, also in San Francisco, appeared the first work of Bud Fisher, Mr Mutt, soon to develop into Mutt and Jeff, the first of the great hits and still one of the best known of the comic strips. Fisher's arrival on the scene corresponds to that of Irving Berlin in ragtime. He had a great talent, hit upon something which took the popular fancy, and by his energy helped to establish the comic strip as a fairly permanent idea in the American newspaper.  The files of the San Francisco Chronicle will one day be searched by an enthusiast for the precise date on which Little Jeff appeared in the picture. It is generally believed that the two characters came on together, but this is not so. In the beginning Mr Mutt made his way alone; he was a race-track follower who daily went out to battle and daily fell. Clare Briggs had used the same idea in his Piker Clerk for the Chicago Tribune. The historic meeting with Little Jeff, a sacred moment in our cultural development, occurred during the days before one of Jim Jeffries' fights. It was as Mr Mutt passed the asylum walls that a strange creature confided to the air the notable remark that he himself was Jeffries. Mutt rescued the little gentleman and named him Jeff. In gratitude Jeff daily submits to indignities which might otherwise seem intolerable.   The development in the last twenty years has been rapid, and about two dozen good comics now exist. Historically it remains to be noted that between 1910 and 1916 nearly all the good comics were made into bad burlesque shows; in 1922 the best of them was made into a ballet with scenario and music by John Alden Carpenter, choreography by Adolph Bolm; costumes and settings after designs by George Herriman. Most of the comics have also appeared in the movies; the two things have much in common and some day a thesis for the doctorate in letters will be written to establish the relationship. The writer of that thesis will explain, I hope, why "movies" is a good word and "funnies," as offensive little children name the comic pages, is what charming essayists call an atrocious vocable.  Setting apart the strip which has fantasy-it is practised by Frueh and by Herriman--the most interesting form is that which deals satirically with every-day life; the least entertaining is the one which takes over the sentimental magazine love-story and carries it through endless episodes. The degree of interest points to one of the virtues of the comic strip: it is a great corrective to magazine-cover prettiness. Only one or two frankly pretty-girl strips exist. Petey is the only one which owes its popularity to the high, handsome face and the lovely flanks of its heroine, and even there the pompous awkwardness of the persistent lover has a touch of wilful absurdity.   Mrs Trubble, a second-rate strip unworthy of its originator, is simply a series of pictures dramatizing the vampire home-breaker; I am not even sure she is intended to be pretty. When nearly everything else in the same newspapers is given over to sentimental ity and affected girl-worship, to advice to the love lorn and pretty-prettiness, it is notable that the comic strip remains grotesque and harsh and careless. It is largely concerned with the affairs of men and children, and, as far as I know, there has never been an effective strip made by, for, or of a woman. The strip has been from the start a satirist of manners; remembering that it arrived at the same time as the Chicago World's Fair, recalling the clothes, table manners, and conversation of those days, it is easy to see how the murmured satiric commentary of the strip undermined our self-sufficiency, pricked our conceit, and corrected our gaucherie. To-day the world of Tad, peopled with cake-eaters and finale-hoppers, the world of the Gumps and Gasoline Alley, of Abie the Agent and Mr and Mrs serve the same purpose. I am convinced that none of our realists in fiction come so close to the facts of the average man, none of our satirists are so gentle and so effective. Of course they are all more serious and more conscious of their mission; but-well, exactly who cares?  The best of the realists is Clare Briggs, who is an elusive creator, one who seems at times to feel the medium of the strip not exactly suited to him, and    Mike and Mike at others to find himself at home in it. His single pictures: The Days of Real Sport and When a Feller Needs a Friend, and the now rapidly disappearing Kelly Pool which was technically a strip, are notable recreations of simple life. Few of them are actively funny; some are sentimental. The children of The Days of Real Sport have an astonishing reality and none are more real than the virtually unseen Skinnay, who is always being urged to "come over." They are a gallery of country types, some of them borrowed from literature-the Huck Finn touch is visible-but all of them freshly observed and dryly recorded. Briggs' line is distinctive; one could identify any square inch of his drawings. In Kelly Pool he worked close to Tad's Indoor Sports, and did what Tad hasn't done--created a character, the negro waiter George whom I shall be sorry to lose. George's amateur interest in pool was continually being submerged in his professional interest: :gettings tips, and his "Bad day . . . ba-a-ad day" when tips were low is a little classic. Deserting that scene, Briggs has made a successful comedy of domestic life in Mr and Mrs. No one has come so near to the subject-the grumbling, helpless, assertive, modest, self- satisfied, self-deprecating male, in his contacts with his sensible, occasionally irritable, wife. As often as not these episodes end in quarrels-in utter blackness with harsh bedroom voices continuing a day's exacerbations; again the reconciliations are mushy, again they   are genuine sentiment. And around them plays the child whose one function is to say "Papa loves mamma" at the most appropriate time. It is quite an achievement, for Briggs has made the ungrateful material interesting, and I can recall not one of these strips in which he has cracked a joke. Tad here follows Briggs, respectfully. For Better or Worse is considerably more obvious, but it has Tad's special value, in sharpness of caricature. The surrounding types are brilliantly drawn; only the central characters remain stock figures. Yet the touch of romance in Tad, continually overlaid by his sense of the ridiculous, is precious; he seems aware of the faint aspirations of his characters and recognizes the r6les which they think they are playing while he mercilessly shows up their actuality. The finest of the Indoor Sports are those in which two subordinate characters riddle with sarcasm the pretentions of the others-the clerk pretending to be at ease when the boss brings his son into the office, the lady of the house talking about the new motor car, the smalltown braggart and the city swell-characters out of melodrama, some, and others so vividly taken from life that the very names Tad gives them pass into common speech. He is an inveterate creator and manipulator of slang; whatever phrase he makes or picks up has its vogue for months and his own variations are delightful. Slang is a part of their picture, and he and Walter Hoban are the only masters of it.   Ketten's Day of Rest is another strip of this genre, interesting chiefly as a piece of draughtsmanship. He is the most economical of the comic-strip artists, and his flat characters, without contours or body, have a sort of jack-in- the-box energy and a sardonic obstinacy. The Chicago School 1 have frankly never been able to understand--a parochialism on my part, or a tribute to its exceptional privacy and sophistication. It pretends, of course, to be simple, but the fate of every metropolis is to enter its small-town period at one time or another, to call itself a village, to build a town hall and sink a town pump with a silver handle. The Gumps are common people and the residents of Gasoline Alley are just folks, but I have never been able to understand what they are doing; 1 suspect they do nothing. It seems to me I read columns of conversation daily, and have to continue to the next day to follow the story. The campaign of Andy Gump for election to the Senate gave a little body to the serial storyhe was so abysmally the ignorant Congressman that he began to live. But apart from this, apart from the despairing cry of "Oh, Min," one recalls nothing of the Chicago School except the amusing vocabulary of Syd Smith and that Andy has no chin. It is an excellent symbol; but it isn't enough for daily food.  The small-town school of comic strip flourishes, in the work of Briggs, already mentioned, in Wester's swift sketches of a similar nature, and in Tom   MacNamara's Us Boys. The last of these is an exceptional fake as small-town, but an amusing and genuine strip. It is people by creation of fancy--the alarmingly fat, amiable Skinny, the truculent Eaglebeak Spruder, the little high-brow Van with his innocence and his spectacles, and Emily, if I recall the name, the village vampire at the age of seven. Little happens in Us Boys, but MacNamara has managed to convey a genuine emotion in tracing the complicated relations between his personages-there is actual childhood friendship, actual worry and pride and anger--all rather gently rendered, and with a recognizable language.  It is interesting to note that none of these strips make use of the projectile or the blow as a regular denouement. I have nothing against the solution by violence of delicate problems, but since the comic strip is supposed to be exclusively devoted to physical exploits I think it is well to remark how placid life is in at least one significant branch of the art. In effect all the themes of the comic strip are subjected to a great variety of treatments, and in each of them you will find, on occasions, the illustrated joke. This is the weakest of the strips, and, as if aware of its weakness, its creators give it the snap ending of a blow, or, failing that, show us one character in consternation at the brilliance of the other's wit, flying out of the picture with the cry of "Zowie," indicating his surcharge of emotion. This is not the same   thing as the wilful violence of Mutt and Jeff, where the attack is due to the malice or stupidity of one character, the resentment or revenge of the other.  Mutt is a picaro, one of the few rogues created in America. There is nothing too dishonest for him, nor is there any chance so slim that he won't take it. He has an object in life: he does not do mean or vicious things simply for the pleasure of doing them, and so is vastly superior to the Peck's Bad Boy type of strip which has an apparently endless voguethe type best known in The Katzenjammer Kids. This is the least ingenious, the least interesting as drawing, the sloppiest in colour, the weakest in conception and in execution, of all the strips, and it is the one which has determined the intellectual idea of what all strips are like. It is now divided into two-and they are equally bad. How happy one could be with neither! The other outstanding picaresque strip is Happy Hooligan-the type tramp who with his brother, Gloomy Gus, had added to the gallery of our national mythology. Non est qualis erat--the spark has gone out of him in recent years . Elsewhere you still find that exceptionally immoral and dishonest attitude toward the business standards of America. For the comic strip, especially after you leave the domestic-relations type which is it   A number of comic-strip artists, on achieving fame, stop drawing, leaving that work to copyists of exceptional skill. I do not know whether this is the case in the Happy Hooligan strip.  self realistic and unsentimental, is specifically more violent, more dishonest, more tricky and roguish, than America usually permits its serious arts to be. The strips of cleverness: Foxy Grandpa, The Boy Inventor, Hawkshaw the Detective, haven't great vogue. Boob McNutt, without a brain in his head, beloved by the beautiful heiress, has a far greater following, although it is the least worthy of Rube Goldberg's astonishing creations. But Mutt and Jiggs and Abie the Agent, and Barney Google and Eddie's Friends have so little respect for law, order, the rights of property, the sanctity of money, the romance of marriage, and all the other foundations of American life, that if they were put into fiction the Society for the Suppression of Everything would hale them incontinently to court and our morals would be saved again.  The Hall-room Boys (now known as Percy and Ferdy, I think) are also picaresque; the indigent pretenders to social eminence who do anything to get on. They are great bores, not because one foresees the denunciation at the end, but because they somehow fail to come to life, and one doesn't care whether they get away with it or not.  Abie and Jerry on the Job are good strips because they are self-contained, seldom crack jokes, and have each a significant touch of satire. Abie is the Jew of commerce and the man of common sense; you have seen him quarrel with a waiter because of an overcharge of ten cents, and, encouraged by his   companion, replying, "Yes, and it ain't the principle, either; it's the ten cents." You have seen a thousand tricks by which he once sold Complex motor cars and now promotes cinema shows or prize fights. He is the epitome of one side of his race, and his attractiveness is as remarkable as his jargon. Jerry's chief fault is taking a stock situation and prolonging it; his chief virtue, at the moment, is his funny, hardboiled attitude towards business. Mr Givney, the sloppy sentimentalist who is pleased because some one took him for Mr Taft ("Nice, clean fun," says Jerry of that), is faced with the absurd Jerry, who demolishes efficiency systems and the romance of big business and similar nonsense with his devastating logic or his complete stupidity. The railway station at New Monia hasn't the immortal character of The Toonerville Trolley (that meets all the trains) because Fontaine Fox has a far more entertaining manner than Hoban, and because Fox is actually a caricaturist--all of his figures are grotesque, the powerful Katinka or Aunt Eppie not more so than the Skipper. Hoban and Hershfield both understate; Fox exaggerates grossly; but with his exaggeration he is so ingenious, so inventive that each strip is funny and the total effect is the creation of character in the Dickens sense. It is not the method of Mutt and Jeff nor of Barney Google in which Billy de Beck has done much with a luckless wight, a sentimentalist, and an endearing fool all rolled into one.   These are the strips which come to life each day, without forcing, and which stay long in memory. I am stating the case for the strip in general and have gone so far as to speak well of some 1 do not admire, nor read with animation. The continued existence of others remains a mystery to me; why they live beyond change, and presumably beyond accidental death, is one of the things no one can profitably spec ulate upon. I do not see why I should concede any thing more to the enemies of the strip. In one of Life's burlesque numbers there was a page of comics expertly done by j held in the manner of our most popular artists. Each of the half dozen strips illustrated the joke: 'Who was that lady I seen you with on the street last night?" "That wasn't a lady; that was my wife." Like so many parodies, this arrived too late, for the current answer is, That wasn't a street; that was an alley." Each picture ended in a slam and a cry--also belated. The actual demolition of the slam ending was accomplished by T. E. Pow ers, who touches the field of the comic strip rarely, and then with his usual ferocity. In a footnote to a cartoon he drew Mike and Mike. In six pictures four represented one man hitting the other; once to emphasize a pointless joke, twice thereafter for no reason at all, and finally to end the picture. It was destruction by exaggeration; and no comic strip artist missed the point.  At the extremes of the comic strip are the realistic   school and the fantastic--and of fantasy there are but few practitioners. Tad has some of the quality in Judge Rummy, but for the most part the Judge' and Fedink and the rest are human beings dressed up as dogs--they are out of Aesop, not out of LaFontaine. But the Judge is actually funny, and I recall an inhuman and undoglike episode in which he and Fedink each claimed to have the loudest voice, and so in midwinter, in a restaurant, each lifted up his voice and uttered and shouted and bellowed the word "Strawberries" until they were properly thrown into the street. This is the kind of madness which is required in fantasy, and Goldberg occasionally has it. He is the most versatile of the lot; he has created characters, and scenes, and continuous episodesfoolish questions and meetings of ladies' clubs and inventions (not so good as Heath Robinson's) and through them there has run a wild grotesquerie. The tortured statues of his decors are marvelous, the way he pushes stupidity and ugliness to their last possible point, and humour into everything, is amazing. Yet I feel he is manque, because he has never found a perfect medium for his work.  Frueh is a fine artist in caricature and could have no such difficulty. When he took it into his head to do a daily strip he was bound to do something exceptional, and he succeeded. It is a highly sophisticated thing in its humour, in its subjects, and pre-eminently in its execution. His series on prohibition enforce   ment had infinite ingenuity, so also his commentaries on political events in New York city. He remains a caricaturist in these strips, indicating, by his use of the medium, that its possibilities are not exhausted. Yet for all his dealing with "ideas" his method remains fantastic, and although he isn't technically a comic-strip artist he is the best approach to the one artist whom I have only mentioned, George Herriman, and to his immortal creation. For there is, in and outside the comic strip, a solitary and incomprehensible figure which must be treated apart: The Krazy Kat that Walks by Himself.  KRAZY KAT, the daily comic strip of George Herriman is, to me, the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory work of art produced in America to-day. With those who hold that a comic strip cannot be a work of art I shall not traffic. The qualities of Krazy Kat are irony and fantasy-exactly the same, it would appear, as distinguish The Revolt of the Angels; it is wholly beside the point to indicate a preference for the work of Anatole France, which is in the great line, in the major arts. It happens that in America iron and fantasy are practised in the major arts by only one or two men, producing high-class trash; and Mr Herriman, working in a despised medium, without an atom of pretentiousness, is day after day producing something essentially fine. It is the result of a naive sensibility rather like that of the douanier Rousseau; it does not lack intelligence, because it is a thought-out, a constructed piece of work. In the second order of the world's art it is superbly first rate-and a delight! For ten years, daily and frequently on Sunday, Krazy Kat has appeared in America; in that time we have accepted and praised a hundred fakes from Europe and Asia-silly and trashy plays, bad painting, woful operas, iniquitous religions, everything paste and brummagem, has had its vogue with us; and a genuine, honest native product has gone unnoticed until in the year of grace 1922 a ballet brought it a tardy and grudging acclaim.  Herriman is our great master of the fantastic and his early career throws a faint light on the invincible creation which is his present masterpiece. For all of his other things were comparative failures. He could not find, in the realistic framework he chose, an appropriate medium for his imaginings, or even for the strange draughtsmanship which is his natural mode of expression. The Family Upstairs seemed to the realist reader simply incredible; it failed to give him the pleasure of recognizing his neighbours in their more ludicrous moments. The Dingbats, hapless wretches, had the same defect. Another strip came nearer to providing the right tone: Don Koyote and Sancho Pansy; Herriman's mind has always been preoccupied with the mad knight of La Mancha, who reappears transfigured in Krazy Kat. And-although the inspirations are never literary-when it isn't Cervantes it is Dickens to whom he has the greatest affinity. The Dickens mode operated in Baron Bean-a figure half Micawber, half Charlie Chaplin as man of the world. I have noted, in writing of Chaplin, Mr Herriman’s acute and sympathetic appreciation of the first few moments of The Kid. It is only fair to say here that he had himself done the same thing in his medium. Baron Bean was always in rags, penniless, hungry; but he kept his man Grimes, and Grimes did his dirty work, Grimes was the Baron's outtlet, and Grimes, faithful retainer, held by bonds of admiration and respect, helped the Baron in his  one great love affair. Like all of Herriman's people, they lived on the enchanted mesa (pronounced: macey) by Coconino, near the town of Yorba Linda. The Baron was inventive; lacking the money to finance the purchase of a postage stamp, he entrusted a love letter to a carrier pigeon; and his "Go, my paloma," on that occasion, is immortal. Some of these characters are reappearing in Herriman's latest work: Stumble Inn. Of this I have not seen enough to be sure. It is a mixture of fancy and realism; Mr Stumble himself is the Dickens character again-the sentimental, endearing innkeeper who would rather lose his only patron than kill a favourite turkey cock for Thanksgiving. I have heard that recently a litter of pups has been found in the cellar of the inn; so I should judge that fantasy has won the day. For it is Herriman's bent to disguise what he has to say in creations of the animal world which are neither human nor animal, but each sui generis.  That is how the Kat started. The thought of a friendship between a cat and a mouse amused Herriman and one day he wrote them in as a footnote to The Family Upstairs. On their first appearance they played marbles while the family quarreled; and in the last picture the marble dropped through a hole in the bottom line. An office boy named Willie was the first to recognize the strange virtues of Krazy Kat. As surely as he was the greatest of office boys, so the   greatest of editors, Arthur Brisbane, was the next to praise. He urged Herriman to keep the two characters in action; within a week they began a semi-independent existence in a strip an inch wide under the older strip. Slowly they were detached, were placed at one side, and naturally stepped into the full character of a strip when the Family departed. In time the Sundays appeared-three quarters of a page, involving the whole Krazy Kat and Ignatz families' and the flourishing town of Coconino-the flora and fauna of that enchanted region which Herriman created out of his memories of the Arizona desert he so dearly loves. In one of his most metaphysical pictures Herriman presents Krazy as saying to Ignatz: "I ain't a Kat . . . and I ain't Krazy" (I put dots to indicate the lunatic shifting of background which goes on while these remarks are made; although the action is continuous and the characters motionless, it is in keeping with Herriman's method to have the backdrop in a continual state of agitation; you never   I must hasten to correct an erroneous impression which may have caused pain to many of Krazy's admirers. The three children, Milton, Marshall, and Irving, are of Ignatz, not, as Mr Stark Young says, of Krazy. Krazy is not an unmarried mother. For the sake of the record I may as well note here the names of the other principals: Offisa Bull Pupp; Mrs Ignatz Mice; Kristofer Kamel; Joe Bark the moon hater; Don Kiyoti, that inconsequential heterodox; Joe Stork, alias Jose Cigueno; Mock Duck; Kolin Kelly the brick merchant, Walter Cephus Austridge; and the Kat Klan: Aunt Tabby, Uncle Tom, Krazy Katbird, Osker Wildcat, Alec Kat, and the Krazy Katfish.  know when a shrub will become. a redwood, or a hut a church) . . . "it's wot's behind me that I am . . . it's the idea behind me, 'Ignatz' and that's wot I am." In an attitude of a contortionist Krazy points to the blank space behind him, and it is there that we must look for the "Idea." It is not far to seek. There is a plot and there is a theme-and considering that since 1913 or so there have been some three thousand strips, one may guess that the variations are infinite. The plot is that Krazy (androgynous, but according to his creator willing to be either) is in love with Ignatz Mouse; Ignatz, who is married, but vagrant, despises the Kat, and his one joy in life is to "Krease that Kat's bean with a brick" from the brickyard of Kolin Kelly. The fatuous Kat (Stark Young has found the perfect word for him: he is crack-brained) takes the brick, by a logic and a cosmic memory presently to be explained, as a symbol of love; he cannot, therefore, appreciate the efforts of Offisa B. Pupp to guard him and to entrammel the activities of Ignatz Mouse (or better, Mice). A deadly war is waged between Ignatz and Offisa Pupp-the latter is himself romantically in love with Krazy; and one often sees pictures in which Krazy and Ignatz conspire together to outwit the officer, both wanting the same thing, but with motives all at cross-purposes. This is the major plot; it is clear that the brick has little to do with the violent endings of other strips, for it is surcharged with emotions. It frequently  comes not at the end, but at the beginning of an action; sometimes it does not arrive. It is a symbol. The theme is greater than the plot. John Alden Carpenter has pointed out in the brilliant little foreword' to his ballet, that Krazy Kat is a combination of Parsifal and Don Quixote, the perfect fool and the perfect knight. Ignatz is Sancho Panza and, I should say, Lucifer. He loathes the sentimental excursions, the philosophic ramblings of Krazy; he interrupts with a well-directed brick the romantic excesses of his companion. For example: Krazy blindfolded and with the scales of Justice in his hand declares: "Things is all out of perpotion, 'Ignatz.' " "In what way, fool!" enquires the Mice as the scene shifts to the edge of a pool in the middle of the desert. "In the way of 'ocean' for a instinct." "Well!" asks Ignatz. They are plunging head down into midsea, and only their hind legs, tails, and words are visible: "The ocean is so innikwilly distribitted." They appear, each prone on a mountain peak, above the clouds, and the Kat says casually across the chasm to Ignatz: "Take 'Denva, Kollorado and 'Tulsa, Okrahoma' they ain't got no ocean a tall-" (they are tossed by a vast sea, together in a packing-case) "while Sem Frencisco, Kellafornia, and Bostin, Messachoosit, has got more ocean than they can possibly use"-whereon Ignatz properly distributes a brick evenly on Krazy's noodle. Ignatz "has no time" for   See Appendix.  foolishness; he is a realist and Sees Things as They ARE. "I don't believe in Santa Claus," says he; "I'm too broad-minded and advanced for such nonsense." But Mr Herriman, who is a great ironist, understands pity. It is the destiny of Ignatz never to know what his brick means to Krazy. He does not enter into the racial memories of the Kat which go back to the days of Cleopatra, of the Bubastes, when Kats were held sacred. Then, on a beautiful day, a mouse fell in love with Krazy, the beautiful daughter of Kleopatra, Kat; bashful, advised by a soothsayer to write his love, he carved a declaration on a brick and, tossing the "missive," was accepted, although he had nearly killed the Kat. "When the Egyptian day is done it has become the Romeonian custom to crease his lady's bean with a brick laden with tender sentiments . . . through the tide of dusty years" . . . the tradition continues. But only Krazy knows this. So at the end it is the incurable romanticist, the victim of acute Bovaryisme, who triumphs; for Krazy faints daily in full possession of his illusion, and Ignatz, stupidly hurling his brick, thinking to injure, fosters the illusion and keeps Krazy "heppy."  Not always, to be sure. Recently we beheld Krazy smok an "eligint Hawanna cigar" and sighing for Ignatz; the smoke screen he produced hid him from view when Ignatz passed, and before the Mice could turn back, Krazy had handed over the   cigar to Offisa Pupp and departed, saying "Looking at 'Offisa Pupp' smoke himself up like a chimly is werra werra intrisking, but it is more wital that I find 'Ignatz' "-wherefore Ignatz, thinking the smoke screen a ruse, hurls his brick, blacks the officer's eye, and is promptly chased by the limb of the law. Up to this point you have the usual technique of the comic strip, as old as Shakespeare. But note the final picture of Krazy beholding the pursuit, himself disconsolate, unbricked, alone, muttering: "Ah, there him is-playing tag with 'Offisa Pupp'-just like the boom compenions wot they is." It is this touch of irony and pity which transforms all of Herriman's work, which relates it, for all that the material is preposterous, to something profoundly true and moving. It isn't possible to retell these pictures; but that is the only way, until they are collected and published, that I can give the impression of Herriman's gentle irony, of his understanding of tragedy, of the sancta simplicitas, the innocent loveliness in the heart of a creature more like Pan than any other creation of our time. Given the general theme, the variations are innumerable, the ingenuity never flags. I use haphazard examples from 1918 to 1923, for though the Kat has changed somewhat since the days when he was even occasionally feline, the essence is the same. Like Charlot, he was always living in a world of his own, and subjecting the commonplaces of actual life   to the test of his higher logic. Does Ignatz say that "the bird is on the wing," Krazy suspects an error and after a careful scrutiny of bird life says that "from rissint obserwation I should say that the wing is on the bird." Or Ignatz observes that Don Kiyote is still running. Wrong, says the magnificent Kat: "he is either still or either running, but not both still and both running." Ignatz passes with a bag containing, he says, bird-seed. "Not that I doubt your word, Ignatz," says Krazy, "but could I give a look!" And he is astonished to find that it is bird-seed, after all, for he had all the time been thinking that birds grew from eggs. It is Ignatz who is impressed by a falling star; for Krazy "them that don't fall" are the miracle. I recommend Krazy to Mr Chesterton, who, in his best moments, will understand. His mind is occupied with eternal oddities, with simple things to which his nature leaves him unreconciled. See him entering a bank and loftily writing a check for thirty million dollars. "You haven't that much money in the bank," says the cashier. "I know it," replies Krazy; "have you?" There is a drastic simplicity about Krazy's movements; he is childlike, regarding with grave eyes the efforts of older people to be solemn, to pretend that things are what they seem; and like children he frightens us because none of our pretensions escapes him. A king to him is a "royal cootie." "Golla," says he, "I always had a ida they was grend, and megnifishint, and wondafil, and me  jestic . . . but my goodniss! It ain't so."' He should be given to the enfant terrible of Hans Andersen who knew the truth about kings. He is, of course, blinded by love. Wandering alone in springtime, he suffers the sight of all things pairing off; the solitude of a lonesome pine worries him and when he finds a second lonesome pine he comes in the dead of night and transplants one to the side of the other, "so that in due course, Nature has her way." But there are moments when the fierce pang of an unrequited passion dies down. "In these blissfil hours my soul will know no strife," he confides to Mr Bum Bill Bee, who, while the conversation goes on, catches sight of Ignatz with a brick, flies off, stings Ignatz from the field, and returns to hear: "In my Kosmis there will be no feeva of discord . . . all my immotions will function in hominy and kind feelings." Or we see him at peace with Ignatz himself. He has bought a pair of spectacles, and seeing that Ignatz has none, cuts them in two, so that each may have a monocle. He is gentle, and gentlemanly, and dear; and these divagations of his are among his loveliest moments; for when irony plays about him he is as helpless-as we are.  To put such a character into music was a fine thought, but Mr Carpenter must have known that he was foredoomed to failure. It was a notable effort, for no other of our composers had seen the possibilities; most, I fear, did not care to "lower them  selves" by the association. Mr Carpenter caught much of the fantasy; it was exactly right for him to make the opening a parody-The Afternoon Nap of a Faun. The "Class A Fit," the Katnip Blues were also good. (There exists a Sunday Krazy of this very scene-it is 1919, I think, and shows hundreds of Krazy Kats in a wild abandoned revel in the Katnip field-a rout, a bacchanale, a satyr-dance, an erotic festival, with our own Krazy playing the viola in the corner, and Ignatz, who has been drinking, going to sign the pledge.) Mr Carpenter almost missed one essential thing: the ecstasy of Krazy when the brick arrives at the end; certainly, as Mr Bolm danced it one felt only the triumph of Ignatz, one did not feel the grand leaping up of Krazy's heart, the fulfilment of desire, as the brick fell upon him. The irony was missing. And it was a mistake for Bolm to try it, since it isn't Russian ballet Krazy requires; it is American dance. One man, one man only can do it right, and I publicly appeal to him to absent him from felicity awhile, and though he do it but once, though but a small number of people may see it, to pay tribute to his one compeer in America, to the one creation equalling his own-I mean, of course, Charlie Chaplin. He has been urged to do many things hostile to his nature; here is one thing he is destined to do. Until then the ballet ought to have Johnny and Ray Dooley for its creators. And I hope that Mr Carpenter hasn't driven other composers off  the subject. There is enough there for Irving Berlin and Deems Taylor to take up. Why don't they? The music it requires is a jazzed tenderness-as Mr Carpenter knew. In their various ways Berlin and Taylor could accomplish it. They may not be able to write profoundly in the private idiom of Krazy. I have preserved his spelling and the quotations have given some sense of his style. The accent is partly Dickens and partly Yiddish-and the rest is not to be identified, for it is Krazy. It was odd that in Vanity Fair's notorious "rankings," Krazy tied with Doctor Johnson, to whom he owes much of his vocabulary. There is a real sense of the colour of words and a high imagination in such passages as "the echoing cliffs of Kaibito" and "on the north side of 'wild-cat peak' the 'snow squaws' shake their winter blankets and bring forth a chill which rides the wind with goad and spur, hurling with an icy hand rime, and frost upon a dreamy land musing in the lap of Spring"; and there is the rhythm of wonder and excitement in "Ooy, 'Ignatz' it's awfil; he's got his legs cut off above his elbows, and he's wearing shoes, and he's standing on top of the water."  Nor, even with Mr Herriman's help, will a ballet get quite the sense of his shifting backgrounds. He is alone in his freedom of movement; in his large pictures and small, the scene changes at will-it is actually our one work in the expressionistic mode.   While Krazy and Ignatz talk they move from mountain to sea; or a tree stunted and flattened with odd ornaments of spots or design, grows suddenly long and thin; or a house changes into a church. The trees in this enchanted mesa are almost always set in flower pots with Coptic and Egyptian designs in the foliage as often as on the pot. There are adobe walls, fantastic cactus plants, strange fungus and growths. And they compose designs. For whether he be a primitive or an expressionist, Herriman is an artist; his works are built up; there is a definite relation between his theme and his structure, and between his lines, masses, and his page. His masterpieces in colour show a new delight, for he is as naive and as assured with colour as with line or black and white. The little figure of Krazy built around the navel, is amazingly adaptable, and Herriman economically makes him express all the emotions with a turn of the hand, a bending of that extraordinary starched bow he wears round the neck, or with a twist of his tail. And he has had much to express for he has suffered much. I return to the vast enterprises of the Sunday pictures. There is one constructed entirely on the bias. Ignatz orders Krazy to push a huge rock off its base, then to follow it downhill. Down they go, crashing through houses, uprooting trees, tearing tunnels through mountains, the bowlder first, Krazy so intently after that he nearly crashes into it when   it stops. He toils painfully back uphill. "Did it gather any moss!" asks Ignatz. "No." "That's what I thought." "L'il fillossiffa," comments Krazy, "always seeks the truth, and always he finds it." There is the great day in which Krazy hears a lecture on the ectoplasm, how "it soars out into the limitless ether, to roam willya-nilly, unleashed, unfettered, and unbound" which becomes for him: "Just imegine having your 'ectospasm' running around, William and Nilliam, among the unlimitliss etha-golla it's imbillivibil-" until a toy balloon, which looks like Ignatz precipitates a heroic gesture and a tragedy. And there is the greatest of all, the epic, the Odyssean wanderings of the door: Krazy beholds a dormouse, a little mouse with a huge door. It impresses him as being terrible that "a mice so small, so dellikit" should carry around a door so heavy with weight. (At this point their Odyssey begins; they use the door to cross a chasm.) "A door is so useless without a house is hitched to it." (It changes into a raft and they go down stream.) "It has no ikkinomikil value." (They dine off the door.) "It leeks the werra werra essentials of helpfilniss." (It shelters them from a hailstorm.) "Historically it is all wrong and misleading." (It fends the lightning.) "As a thing of beauty it fails in every rispeck." (It shelters them from the sun and while Krazy goes on to deliver a lecture: "You never see Mr Steve Door, or Mr Torra Door, or Mr Kuspa Door doing it, do you?" and "Can you imagine my li'l friends Ignatz Mice boddering himself with a door?") his li'l friend Ignatz has appeared with the brick; unseen by Krazy he hurls it; it is intercepted by the door, rebounds, and strikes Ignatz down. Krazy continues his adwice until the dormouse sheers off, and then Krazy sits down to "concentrate his mind on Ignatz and wonda where he is at." Such is our Krazy. Such is the work which America can pride itself on having produced, and can hastily set about to appreciate. It is rich with something we have too little of-fantasy. It is wise with pitying irony; it has delicacy, sensitiveness, and an unearthly beauty. The Strange, unnerving, distorted trees, the language inhuman, un-animal, the events so logical, so wild, are all magic carpets and faery foam-all charged with unreality. Through them wanders Krazy, the most tender and the most foolish of creatures, a gentle monster of our new mythology.

OPAL STREET, as streets go, is no jewel of the first water. It is merely an imitation, and none too good at that. Narrow, unsparkling, uninviting, it stretches meekly off from dull Jefferson Street to the dingy, drab market which forms the north side of Oxford Street. It has no mystery, no allure, either of exclusiveness or of downright depravity ; its usages are plainly significant, an unpretentious little street lined with unpretentious little houses, inhabited for the most part by unpretentious little people.  The dwellings are three stories high, and contain six boxes called by courtesy, rooms a "parlour", a midget of a dining-room, a larger kitchen and, above, a front bedroom seemingly large only because it extends for the full width of the house, a mere shadow of a bathroom, and another back bedroom with windows whose possibilities are spoiled by their outlook on sad and diminutive back-yards. And above these two, still two others built in similar wise.  In one of these houses dwelt a father, a mother and two daughters. Here, as often happens in a home sheltering two generations, opposite, un evenly matched emotions faced each other. In the houses of the rich the satisfied ambition of the older generation is faced by the overwhelming am bition of the younger. Or the elders may find themselves brought in opposition to the blank  indifference and ennui of youth engendered by the realization that there remain no more worlds to conquer; their fathers having already taken all, In houses on Opal Street these niceties of distinction are hardly to be found; there is a more direct and concrete contrast. The satisfied ambition of maturity is a foil for the restless despair of youth, Affairs in the Murray household were advancing towards this stage; yet not a soul in that family of four could have foretold its coming. To Junius and Mattie Murray, who had known poverty and homelessness, the little house on Opal Street repre sented the ne plus ultra of ambition; to their daughter Angela it seemed the dingiest, drabbest chrysalis that had ever fettered the wings of a brilliant butterfly. The stories which Junius and Mattie told of difficulties overcome, of the arduous learning of trades, of the pitiful scraping together of infinitesimal savings, would have made a latter- day Iliad, but to Angela they were merely a description of a life which she at any cost would avoid living. Somewhere in the world were paths which lead to broad thoroughfares, large, bright houses, delicate niceties of existence. Those paths Angela meant to find and frequent. At a very early age she had observed that the good things of life are unevenly distributed; merit is not always rewarded; hard labour does not necessarily entail adequate recompense. Certain fortuitous endow ments, great physical beauty, unusual strength, a certain unswerving singleness of mind, gifts bestowed quite blindly and disproportionately by the forces which control life, these were the quali ties which contributed toward a glowing and pleasant existence.  Angela had no high purpose in life; unlike her sister Virginia, who meant some day to invent a marvellous method for teaching the pianoforte, Angela felt no impulse to discover, or to perfect. True she thought she might become eventually a distinguished painter, but that was because she felt within herself an ability to depict which as far as it went was correct and promising. Her eye for line and for expression was already good and she had a nice feeling for colour. Moreover she possessed the instinct for self-appraisal which taught her that she had much to learn. And she was sure that the knowledge once gained would flower in her case to perfection. But her gift was not for her the end of existence ; rather it was an adjunct to a life which was to know light, pleasure, gaiety and freedom.  Freedom! That was the note which Angela heard oftenest in the melody of living which was to be hers. With a wildness that fell just short of unreasonableness she hated restraint. Her father's earlier days as coachman in a private family, his later successful, independent years as boss car penter, her mother's youth spent as maid to a famous actress, all this was to Angela a manifesta tion of the sort of thing which happens to those enchained it might be by duty, by poverty, by weakness or by colour.  Colour or rather the lack of it seemed to the child the one absolute prerequisite to the life of which she was always dreaming. One might break loose from a too hampering sense of duty; poverty could be overcome; physicians conquered weak ness; but colour, the mere possession of a black or a white skin, that was clearly one of those  w        fortuitous endowments of the gods. Gratitude was no strong ingredient in this girl's nature, yet very often early she began thanking Fate for the chance which in that household of four had bestowed on her the heritage of her mother's fair skin. She might so easily have been, like her father, black, or have received the melange which had resulted in Virginia's rosy bronzeness and her deeply waving black hair. But Angela had received not only her mother's creamy complexion and her soft cloudy, chestnut hair, but she had taken from Junius the aquiline nose, the gift of some remote Indian ancestor which gave to his face and his eldest daughter's that touch of chiselled immobility.    It was from her mother that Angela learned the possibilities for joy and freedom which seemed to her inherent in mere whiteness. No one would have been more amazed than that same mother if she could have guessed how her daughter inter preted her actions. Certainly Mrs. Murray did not attribute what she considered her happy, busy, sheltered life on tiny Opal Street to the accident of her colour; she attributed it to her black husband whom she had been glad and proud to marry. It is equally certain that that white skin of hers had not saved her from occasional contumely and insult. The famous actress for whom she had worked was aware of Mattie's mixed blood and, boasting tem perament rather than refinement, had often dubbed her " white nigger ".  Angela's mother employed her colour very much as she practised certain winning usages of smile        and voice to obtain indulgences which meant much to her and which took nothing from anyone else. Then, too, she was possessed of a keener sense of humour than her daughter; it amused her when by herself to take lunch at an exclusive restaurant whose patrons would have been panic-stricken if they had divined the presence of a " coloured " woman no matter how little her appearance differed from theirs. It was with no idea of disclaiming her own that she sat in orchestra seats which Phila delphia denied to coloured patrons. But when Junius or indeed any other dark friend accom panied her she was the first to announce that she liked to sit in the balcony or gallery, as indeed she did; her infrequent occupation of orchestr^ seats was due merely to a mischievous determination to flout a silly and unjust law.  Her years with the actress had left their mark, a perfectly harmless and rather charming one. At least so it seemed to Junius, whose weakness was for the qualities known as " essentially fem inine ". Mrs. Murray loved pretty clothes, she liked shops devoted to the service of women; she enjoyed being even on the fringe of a fashionable gathering. A satisfaction that was almost ecstatic seized her when she drank tea in the midst of modishly gowned women in a stylish tea-room. It pleased her to stand in the foyer of a great hotel or of the Academy of Music and to be part of the whirling, humming, palpitating gaiety. She had no desire to be of these people, but she liked to look on; it amused and thrilled and kept alive some un quenchable instinct for life which thrived within her. To walk through Wanamaker's on Saturday, to stroll from Fifteenth to Ninth Street on Chestnut,      to have her tea in the Bellevue Stratford, to stand in the lobby of the St. James  fitting on immaculate gloves; all innocent, childish pleasures pursued without malice or envy contrived to cast a glamour over Monday's washing and Tuesday's ironing, the scrubbing of kitchen and bathroom and the fashioning of children's clothes. She was endowed with a humorous and pungent method of presenta tion ; Junius, who had had the wit not to interfere with these little excursions and the sympathy to take them at their face value, preferred one of his wife's sparkling accounts of a Saturday's adventure in " passing " to all the tall stories told by cronies at his lodge.  Much of this pleasure, harmless and charming though it was, would have been impossible with a dark skin.  In these first years of marriage, Mattie, busied with the house and the two babies had given up those excursions. Later, when the children had grown and Junius had reached the stage where he could afford to give himself a half-holiday on Saturdays, the two parents inaugurated a plan of action which eventually became a fixed programme. Each took a child, and Junius went off to a beloved but long since suspended pastime of exploring old Philadelphia, whereas Mattie embarked once more on her social adventures. It is true that Mattie accompanied by brown Virginia could not move quite as freely as when with Angela. But her maternal instincts were sound; her children, their feelings and their faith in her meant much more than the pleasure which she would have been first to call unnecessary and silly. As it happened the children themselves quite unconsciously solved the          dilemma; Virginia found shopping tiring and stupid, Angela returned from her father's adventur ing worn and bored. Gradually the rule was formed that Angela accompanied her mother and Virginia her father.    On such fortuities does life depend. Little Angela Murray, hurrying through Saturday morn ing's scrubbing of steps in order that she might have her bath at one and be with her mother on Chestnut Street at two, never realized that her mother took her pleasure among all these pale people because it was there that she happened to find it. It never occurred to her that the delight which her mother obviously showed in meeting friends on Sunday morning when the whole united Murray family came out of church was the same as she showed on Chestnut Street the previous Saturday, because she was finding the qualities which her heart craved, bustle, excitement and fashion. The daughter could not guess that if the economic status or the racial genius of coloured people had permitted them to run modish hotels or vast and popular department stores her mother would have been there. She drew for herself certain clearly formed conclusions which her subconscious mind thus codified :  First, that the great rewards of life riches, glamour, pleasure, are for white-skinned people only. Secondly, that Junius and Virginia were denied these privileges because they were dark; here her reasoning bore at least an element of verisimilitude but she missed the essential fact that her father and sister did not care for this      type of pleasure. The effect of her fallaciousness was to cause her to feel a faint pity for her unfor tunate relatives and also to feel that coloured people were to be considered fortunate only in the propor tion in which they measured up to the physical standards of white people.  One Saturday excursion left a far-reaching impression. Mrs. Murray and Angela had spent a successful and interesting afternoon. They had browsed among the contents of the small exclusive shops in Walnut Street; they had had soda at Adams' on Broad Street and they were standing finally in the portico of the Walton Hotel deciding with fashionable and idle elegance what they should do next. A thin stream of people con stantly passing threw an occasional glance at the quietly modish pair, the well-dressed, assured woman and the refined and no less assured daughter. The door-man knew them; it was one of Mrs. Murray's pleasures to proffer him a small tip, much appreciated since it was uncalled for. This was the atmosphere which she loved. Angela had put on her gloves and was waiting for her mother, who was drawing on her own with great care, when she glimpsed in the laughing, hurrying Saturday throng the figures of her father and of Virginia. They were close enough for her mother, who saw them too, to touch them by merely des cending a few steps and stretching out her arm. In a second the pair had vanished. Angela saw her mother's face change with trepidation she thought. She remarked: " It's a good thing Papa didn't see us, you'd have had to speak to him, wouldn't you? " But her mother, giving her a distracted glance, made no reply.          That night, after the girls were in bed, Mattie, perched on the arm of her husband's chair, told him about it. "I was at my old game of play acting again to-day, June, passing you know, and darling, you and Virginia went by within arm's reach and we never spoke to you. I'm so ashamed."  But Junius consoled her. Long before their marriage he had known of his Mattie's weakness and its essential harmlessness. " My dear girl, I told you long ago that where no principle was involved, your passing means nothing to me. It's just a little joke ; I don't think you'd be ashamed to acknowledge your old husband anywhere if it were necessary."  " I'd do that if people were mistaking me for a queen," she assured him fondly. But she was silent, not quite satisfied. " After all," she said with her charming frankness, " it isn't you, dear, who make me feel guilty. I really am ashamed to think that I let Virginia pass by without a word. I think I should feel very badly if she were to know it. I don't believe I'll ever let myself be quite as silly as that again."  But of this determination Angela, dreaming excitedly of Saturdays spent in turning her small olive face firmly away from peering black counten ances was, unhappily, unaware.      SATURDAY came to be the day of the week for Angela, but her sister Virginia preferred Sundays. She loved the atmosphere of golden sanctity which seemed to hover with a sweet glory about the stodgy, shabby little dwelling. Usually she came downstairs first so as to enjoy by herself the blessed " Sunday feeling " which, she used to declare, would have made it possible for her to recognize the day if she had awakened to it even in China. She was only twelve at this time, yet she had already developed a singular aptitude and liking for the care of the home, and this her mother gratefully fostered. Gradually the custom was formed of turning over to her small hands all the duties of Sunday morning; they were to her a ritual. First the kettle must be started boiling, then the pave ment swept. Her father's paper must be carried up and left outside his door. Virginia found a nameless and sweet satisfaction in performing these services.  She prepared the Sunday breakfast which was always the same, bacon and eggs, strong coffee with good cream for Junius, chocolate for the other three and muffins. After the kettle had boiled and the muffins were mixed it took exactly half an hour to complete preparations. Virginia always went about these matters in the same way. She set the          muffins in the oven, pursing her lips and frowning a little just as she had seen her mother do; then she went to the foot of the narrow, enclosed staircase and called " hoo-hoo " with a soft rising inflection,  " last call to dinner," her father termed it. And finally, just for those last few minutes before the family descended she went into the box of a parlour and played hymns, old-fashioned and stately tunes,  " How firm a foundation ", " The spacious firmament on high ", " Am I a soldier of the Cross ". Her father's inflexible bass, booming down the stairs, her mother's faint alto in thirds mingled with her own sweet treble; a shaft of sunlight, faint and watery in winter, strong and golden in summer, shimmering through the room in the morning dusk completed for the little girl a sensation of happiness which lay perilously near tears.    After breakfast came the bustle of preparing for church. Junius of course had come down in complete readiness; but the others must change their dresses; Virginia had mislaid her Sunday hair-ribbon again; Angela had discovered a rip in her best gloves and could not be induced to go down until it had been mended. " Wait for me just a minute, Jinny dear, I can't go out looking like this, can I? " She did not like going to church, at least not to their church, but she did care about her appearance and she liked the luxuriousness of being " dressed up " on two successive days. At last the little procession filed out, Mattie hoping that they would not be late, she did hate it so; Angela thinking that this was a stupid way to spend        Sunday and wondering at just what period of one's life existence began to shape itself as you wanted it. Her father's thoughts were inchoate; expressed they would have revealed a patriarchal aspect almost biblical. He had been a poor boy, homeless, a nobody, yet somehow he had contrived in his mid-forties to attain to the status of a respect able citizen, house-owner, a good provider. He possessed a charming wife and two fine daughters, and as was befitting he was accompanying them to the house of the Lord. As for Virginia, no one to see her in her little red hat and her mother's cut-over blue coat could have divined how near she was to bursting with happiness. Father, mother and children, well-dressed, well-fed, united, going to church on a beautiful Sunday morning; there was an immense cosmic rightness about all this which she sensed rather than realized. She envied no one the incident of finer clothes or a larger home; this unity was the core of happiness, all other satisfactions must radiate from this one; greater happiness could be only a matter of degree but never of essence. When she grew up she meant to live the same kind of life; she would marry a man exactly like her father and she would conduct her home exactly as did her mother. Only she would pray very hard every day for five children, two boys and two girls and then a last little one, it was hard for her to decide whether this should be a boy or a girl, which should stay small for a long, long time. And on Sundays they would all go to church.  Intent on her dreaming she rarely heard the sermon. It was different with the hymns, for they constituted the main part of the service for her        father, and she meant to play them again for him later in the happy, golden afternoon or the grey dusk of early evening. But first there were acquaintances to greet, friends of her parents who called them by their first names and who, in speak ing of Virginia and Angela still said: " And these are the babies; my, how they grow! It doesn't seem as though it could be you, Mattie Ford, grown up and with children ! "  On Communion Sundays the service was very late, and Angela would grow restless and twist about in her seat, but the younger girl loved the sudden, mystic hush which seemed to descend on the congre gation. Her mother's sweetly merry face took on a certain childish solemnity, her father's stern profile softened into beatific expectancy. In the exquisite diction of the sacramental service there were certain words, certain phrases that almost made the child faint; the minister had a faint burr in his voice and somehow this lent a peculiar underlying resonance to his intonation ; he half spoke, half chanted and when, picking up the wafer he began " For in the night " and then broke it, Virginia could have cried out with the ecstasy which filled her. She felt that those who partook of the bread and wine were somehow transfigured; her mother and father wore an expression of ineffable content as they returned to their seats and there was one woman, a middle-aged, mischief-making person, who re turned from taking the sacrament, walking down the aisle, her hands clasped loosely in front of her and her face so absolutely uplifted that Virginia used to hasten to get within earshot of her after the church was dismissed, sure that her first words must savour of something mystic          and holy. But her assumption proved always to be ill-founded.    The afternoon and the evening repeated the morning's charm but in a different key. Usually a few acquaintances dropped in; the parlour and dining-room were full for an hour or more of pleasant, harmless chatter. Mr. Henson, the policeman, a tall, yellow man with freckles on his nose and red " bad hair " would clap Mr. Murray on the back and exclaim " I tell you what, June," which always seemed to Virginia a remarkably daring way in which to address her tall, dignified father. Matthew Henson, a boy of sixteen, would inevitably be hovering about Angela who found him insufferably boresome and made no effort to hide her ennui. Mrs. Murray passed around rather hard cookies and delicious currant wine, talking stitches and patterns meanwhile with two or three friends of her youth with a frequent injec tion of " Mame, do you remember ! "  Presently the house, emptied of all but the family, grew still again, dusk and the lamp light across the street alternately panelling the walls. Mrs. Murray murmured something about fixing a bite to eat, " I'll leave it in the kitchen if any body wants it ". Angela reflected aloud that she had still to get her Algebra or History or French as the case might be, but nobody moved. What they were really waiting for was for Virginia to start to play and finally she would cross the narrow absurdity of a room and stretching out her slim, brown hands would begin her version, a glorified one, of the hymns which they had sung in church      that morning, and then the old favourites which she had played before breakfast. Even Angela, somewhat remote and difficult at first, fell into this evening mood and asked for a special tune or a repetition: " I like the way you play that, Jinny ". For an hour or more they were as close and united as it is possible for a family to be.  At eight o'clock or thereabouts Junius said exactly as though it had not been in his thoughts all even ing: "Play the 'Dying Christian', daughter". And Virginia, her treble sounding very childish and shrill against her father's deep, unyielding bass, began Pope's masterpiece on the death of a true believer. The magnificently solemn words: " Vital spark of heavenly flame ", the strangely appropriate minor music filled the little house with an awesome beauty which was almost palp able. It affected Angela so that in sheer self- defence she would go out in the kitchen and eat her share of the cold supper set by her mother. But Mattie, although she never sang this piece, remained while her husband and daughter sang on. Death triumphant and mighty had no fears for her. It was inevitable, she knew, but she would never have to face it alone. When her husband died, she would die too, she was sure of it; and if death came to her first it would be only a little while before Junius would be there stretching out his hand and guiding her through all the rough, strange places just as years ago, when he had been a coachman to the actress for whom she worked, he had stretched out his good, honest hand and had saved her from a dangerous and equivocal position. She wiped away happy and grateful tears.          ' The world recedes, it disappears," sang Virginia. But it made no difference how far it drifted away as long as the four of them were together; and they would always be together, her father and mother and she and Angela. With her visual mind she saw them proceeding endlessly through space; there were her parents, arm in arm, and she and but to-night and other nights she could not see Angela; it grieved her to lose sight thus of her sister, she knew she must be there, but grope as she might she could not find her. And then quite suddenly Angela was there again, but a different Angela, not quite the same as in the beginning of the picture.  And suddenly she realized that she was doing four things at once and each of them with all the intent- ness which she could muster; she was singing, she was playing, she was searching for Angela and she was grieving because Angela as she knew her was lost forever.  " Oh Death, oh Death, where is thy sting! " the hymn ended triumphantly, she and the piano as usual came out a little ahead of Junius which was always funny. She said, " Where's Angela? " and knew what the answer would be. " I'm tired, mummy! I guess I'll go to bed."  c You ought to, you got up so early and you've been going all day."  Kissing her parents good-night she mounted the stairs languidly, her whole being pervaded with the fervid yet delicate rapture of the day.          MONDAY morning brought the return of the busy, happy week. It meant wash-day for Mattie, for she and Junius had never been able to raise their menage to the status either of a maid or of putting out the wash. But this lack meant nothing to her, she had been married fifteen years and still had the ability to enjoy the satisfaction of having a home in which she had full sway instead of being at the beck and call of others. She was old enough to remember a day when poverty for a coloured girl connoted one of three things : going out to service, working as ladies' maid, or taking a genteel but poorly paid position as seamstress with one of the families of the rich and great on Rittenhouse Square, out West Walnut Street or in one of the numerous impeccable, aristocratic suburbs of Philadelphia.  She had tried her hand at all three of these possibilities, had known what it meant to rise at five o'clock, start the laundry work for a patronizing indifferent family of people who spoke of her in her hearing as " the girl " or remarked of her in a slightly lower but still audible tone as being rather better than the usual run of niggers, " She never steals, I'd trust her with anything and she isn't what you'd call lazy either." For this family she had prepared breakfast, gone back to her        washing, served lunch, had taken down the clothes, sprinkled and folded them, had gone upstairs and made three beds, not including her own and then had returned to the kitchen to prepare dinner. At night she nodded over the dishes and finally stumbling up to the third floor fell into her unmade bed, sometimes not even fully undressed. And Tuesday morning she would begin on the long and tedious strain of ironing. For this she received four dollars a week with the privilege of every other Sunday and every Thursday off. But she could have no callers.  As a seamstress, life had been a little more en durable but more precarious. The wages were better while they lasted, she had a small but comfortable room; her meals were brought up to her on a tray and the young girls of the house holds in which she was employed treated her with a careless kindness which while it still had its element of patronage was not offensive. But such families had a disconcerting habit of closing their households and departing for months at a time, and there was Mattie stranded and peril ously trying to make ends meet by taking in sewing. But her clientele was composed of girls as poor as she, who either did their own dressmaking or could afford to pay only the merest trifle for her really exquisite and meticulous work.    The situation with the actress had really been the best in many, in almost all, respects. But it presented its pitfalls. Mattie was young, pretty and innocent; the actress was young, beautiful and sophisticated. She had been married twice        and had been the heroine of many affairs; maidenly modesty, virtue for its own sake, were qualities long since forgotten; high ideals and personal self-respect were too abstract for her slightly coarsened mind to visualize, and at any rate they were incomprehensible and even absurd in a servant, and in a coloured servant to boot. She knew that in spite of Mattie's white skin there was black blood in her veins; in fact she would not have taken the girl on had she not been coloured; all her servants must be coloured, for hers was a carelessly conducted household, and she felt dimly that all coloured people are thickly streaked with immorality. They were naturally loose, she reasoned, when she thought about it at all. " Look at the number of mixed bloods among them; look at Mattie herself for that matter, a perfectly white nigger if ever there was one. I'll bet her mother wasn't any better than she should be."  When the girl had come to her with tears in her eyes and begged her not to send her as mes senger to the house of a certain Haynes Brokinaw, politician and well-known man about town, Madame had laughed out loud. " How ridicu lous ! He'll treat you all right. I should like to know what a girl like you expects. And anyway, if I don't care, why should you? Now run along with the note and don't bother me about this again. I hire you to do what I want, not to do as you want." She was not even jealous, of a coloured working girl! And anyway, constancy was no virtue in her eyes; she did not possess it herself and she valued it little in others,  "        Mattie was in despair. She was receiving twenty-five dollars a month, her board, and a comfortable, pleasant room. She was seeing something of the world and learning of its amen ities. It was during this period that she learned how very pleasant indeed life could be for a person possessing only a very little extra money and a white skin. But the special attraction which her present position held for her was that every day she had a certain amount of time to call her own, for she was Madame's personal servant; in no wise was she connected with the routine of keeping the house. If Madame elected to spend the whole day away from home, Mattie, once she had arranged for the evening toilette, was free to act and to go where she pleased.  And now here was this impasse looming up with Brokinaw. More than once Mattie had felt his covetous eyes on her; she had dreaded going to his rooms from the very beginning. She had even told his butler, " I'll be back in half an hour for the answer"; and she would not wait in the great square hall as he had indicated for there she was sure that danger lurked. But the third time Brokinaw was standing in the hall. "Just come into my study," he told her, " while I read this and write the answer." And he had looked at her with his cold, green eyes and had asked her why she was so out of breath. " There's no need to rush so, child; stay here and rest. I'm in no hurry, I assure you. Are you really coloured? You know, I've seen lots of white girls not as pretty as you. Sit here and tell me all about your mother, and your father. Do do you        remember him? " His whole bearing reeked with intention.  Within a week Madame was sending her again and she had suggested fearfully the new coach man. " No," said Madame. " It's Wednesday, his night off, and I wouldn't send him anyway; coachmen are too hard to keep nowadays ; you're all getting so independent." Mattie had come down from her room and walked slowly, slowly to the corner where the new coachman, tall and black and grave, was just hailing a car. She ran to him and jerked down the arm which he had just lifted to seize the railing. " Oh, Mr. Murray," she stammered. He had been so astonished and so kind. Her halting explanation done, he took the note in silence and delivered it, and the next night and for many nights thereafter they walked through the silent, beautiful square, and Junius had told her haltingly and with fear that he loved her. She threw her arms about his neck: " And I love you too."  ' You don't mind my being so dark then? Lots of coloured girls I know wouldn't look at a black man."  But it was partly on account of his colour that she loved him; in her eyes his colour meant safety. " Why should I mind? " she asked with one of her rare outbursts of bitterness, " my own colour has never brought me anything but insult and trouble."  The other servants, it appeared, had told him that sometimes she he hesitated " passed ".  ' Yes, yes, of course I do," she explained it eagerly, " but never to them. And anyway when I am alone what can I do? I can't label myself,      And if Fm hungry or tired and I'm near a place where they don't want coloured people, why should I observe their silly old rules, rules that are un natural and unjust, because the world was made for everybody, wasn't it, Junius? "  She had told him then how hard and joyless her girlhood life had been, she had known such dreadful poverty and she had been hard put to it to keep herself together. But since she had come to live with Madame Sylvio she had glimpsed, thanks to her mistress's careless kindness, some thing of the life of comparative ease and beauty and refinement which one could easily taste if he possessed just a modicum of extra money and the prerequisite of a white skin.  " I've only done it for fun but I won't do it any more if it displeases you. I'd much rather live in the smallest house in the world with you, Junius, than be wandering around as I have so often, lonely and unknown in hotels and restaur ants." Her sweetness disarmed him. There was no reason in the world why she should give up her harmless pleasure unless, he added rather sternly, some genuine principle were involved.  It was the happiest moment of her life when Junius had gone to Madame and told her that both he and Mattie were leaving. " We are going to be married," he announced proudly. The actress had been sorry to lose her, and wanted to give her a hundred dollars, but the tall, black coachman would not let his wife accept it. " She is to have only what she earned," he said in stern refusal. He hated Madame Sylvio for having thrown the girl in the way of Haynes Brokinaw,      They had married and gone straight into the little house on Opal Street which later was to become their own. Mattie her husband considered a perfect woman, sweet, industrious, affectionate and illogical. But to her he was God.  When Angela and Virginia were little children and their mother used to read them fairy tales she would add to the ending, " And so they lived happily ever after, just like your father and me."  All this was passing happily through her mind on this Monday morning. Junius was working some where in the neighbourhood; his shop was down on Bainbridge Street, but he tried to devote Mondays and Tuesdays to work up town so that he could run in and help \Mattie on these trying days. Before the advent of the washing machine he used to dart in and out two or three times in the course of a morning to lend a hand to the heavy sheets and the bed-spreads. Now those articles were taken care of in the laundry, but Junius still kept up the pleasant fiction.  Virginia attended school just around the corner, and presently she would come in too, not so much to get her own lunch as to prepare it for her mother. She possessed her father's attitude toward Mattie as someone who must be helped, indulged and protected. Moreover she had an unusually keen sense of gratitude toward her father and mother for their kindness and their unselfish ambitions for their children. Jinny never tired of hearing of the difficult childhood of her parents. She knew of no story quite so thrilling as the account of their early trials and difficulties. She thought it wonderfully sweet of them to plan, as? they constantly did, better things for their daughters.  c        " My girls shall never come through my experi ences," Mattie would say fimly. They were both to be school-teachers and independent.  It is true that neither of them felt any special leaning toward this calling. Angela frankly despised it, but she supposed she must make her living some way. The salary was fairly good in fact, very good for a poor girl and there would be the long summer vacation. At fourteen she knew already how much money she would save during those first two or three years and how she would spend those summer vacations. But although she proffered this much information to her family she kept her plans to herself. Mattie often pondered on this lack of openness in her older daughter. Virginia was absolutely transparent. She did not think she would care for teaching either, that is, not for teaching in the ordinary sense. But she realized that for the present that was the best profession which her parents could have chosen for them. She would spend her summers learning all she could about methods of teaching music.  " And a lot of good it will do you," Angela scoffed. " You know perfectly well that there are no coloured teachers of music in the public schools here in Philadelphia." But Jinny thought it possible that there might be. " When Mamma was coming along there were very few coloured teachers at all, and now it looks as though there'd be plenty of chance for us. And anyway you never know your luck."  By four o'clock the day's work was over and Mattie free to do as she pleased. This was her idle hour. The girls would get dinner, a Monday version of whatever the main course had been the        day before. Their mother was on no account to be disturbed or importuned. To-day as usual she sat in the Morris chair in the dining-room, dividing her time between the Sunday paper and the girls' chatter. It was one of her most cherished ex periences, this sense of a day's hard labour far behind her, the happy voices of her girls, her joyous expectation of her husband's home-coming. Usually the children made a game of their pre parations, recalling some nonsense of their early childhood days when it had been their delight to dress up as ladies. Virginia would approach Angela: " Pardon me, is this Mrs. Henrietta Jones? " And Angela, drawing herself up haughtily would reply: " Er, really you have the advantage of me." Then Virginia : "Oh pardon! I thought you were Mrs. Jones and I had heard my friend Mrs, Smith speak of you so often and since you were in the neighbourhood and passing, I was going to ask you in to have some ice-cream ". The game of course being that Angela should immediately drop her haughtiness and proceed for the sake of the goodies to ingratiate herself into her neighbour's esteem. It was a poor joke, long since worn thin, but the two girls still used the greeting and for some reason it had become part of the Monday ritual of preparing the supper.  But to-night Angela's response lacked spon taneity. She was absorbed and reserved, even a little sulky. Deftly and swiftly she moved about her work, however, and no one who had not attended regularly on those Monday evening prep arations could have guessed that there was anything on her mind other than complete absorption in the          problem of cutting the bread or garnishing the warmed over roast beef. But Mattie was aware of the quality of brooding in her intense con centration. She had seen it before in her daughter but to-night, though to her practised eye it was more apparent than ever, she could not put her hand on it. Angela's response, if asked what was the matter, would be " Oh, nothing ". It came to her suddenly that her older daughter was growing up; in a couple of months she would be fifteen. Children were often absorbed and moody when they were in their teens, too engaged in finding themselves to care about their e fleet on others. She must see to it that the girl had plenty of rest; perhaps school had been too strenuous for her to-day; she thought the high school programme very badly arranged, five hours one right after the other were much too long. " Angela, child, I think you'd better not be long out of bed to-night; you look very tired to me." Angela nodded. But her father came in then and in the little hubbub that arose about his home-coming and the final preparations for supper her listlessness went without further remark.      THE third storey front was Angela's bed-room. She was glad of its loneliness and security to-night, even if her mother had not suggested her going to bed early she would have sought its shelter immediately after supper. Study for its own sake held no attractions for her; she did not care for any of her subjects really except Drawing and French. And when she was drawing she did not consider that she was studying, it was too natur ally a means of self-expression. As for French, she did have to study that with great care, for languages did not come to her with any great readiness, but there was an element of fine lady-ism about the beautiful, logical tongue that made her in accordance with some secret subconscious ambition resolve to make it her own.  The other subjects, History, English, and Physi cal Geography, were not drudgery, for she had a fair enough mind; but then they were not attractive either, and she was lacking in Virginia's dogged resignation to unwelcome duties. Even when Jinny was a little girl she had been known to say manfully in the face of an uncongenial task: " Well I dotta det it done ". Angela was not like that. But to-night she was concentrating with all her power on her work. During the day she had been badly hurt; she had received a wound          whose depth and violence she would not reveal even to her parents, because, and this only in creased the pain, young as she was she knew that there was nothing they could do about it. There was nothing to be done but to get over it. Only she was not developed enough to state this stoicism to herself. She was like a little pet cat that had once formed part of their household; its leg had been badly torn by a passing dog and the poor thing had dragged itself into the house and lain on its cushion patiently, waiting stolidly for this unfamiliar agony to subside. So Angela waited for the hurt in her mind to cease.  But across the history dates on the printed page and through the stately lines of Lycidas she kept seeing Mary Hastings' accusing face, hearing Mary Hastings' accusing voice:  " Coloured ! Angela, you never told me that you were coloured ! "  And then her own voice in tragic but proud be wilderment. " Tell you that I was coloured ! Why of course I never told you that I was coloured. Why should I?"    She had been so proud of Mary Hastings' friend ship. In the dark and tortured spaces of her difficult life it had been a lovely, hidden refuge. It had been an experience so rarely sweet that she had hardly spoken of it even to Virginia. The other girls in her classes had meant nothing to her. At least she had schooled herself to have them mean nothing. Some of them she had known since early childhood; they had lived in her neigh-          bourhood and had gone to the graded schools with her. They had known that she was coloured, for they had seen her with Virginia, and sometimes her tall, black father had come to fetch her home on a rainy day. There had been pleasant enough contacts and intimacies; in the quiet of Jefferson Street they had played " The Farmer in the Dell ", and "Here come three jolly, jolly sailor-boys"; dark retreats of the old market had afforded endless satisfaction for " Hide and Go Seek ". She and those other children had gone shopping arm in arm for school supplies, threading their way in and out of the bustle and confusion that were Columbia Avenue.  As she grew older many of these intimacies lessened, in some cases ceased altogether. But she was never conscious of being left completely alone; there was always some one with whom to eat lunch or who was going her way after school. It was not until she reached the high school that she began to realize how solitary her life was becoming. There were no other coloured girls in her class but there had been only two or three during her school-life, and if there had been any she would not necessarily have confined herself to them; that this might be a good thing to do in sheer self-defence would hardly have occurred to her. But this problem did not confront her; what did confront her was that the very girls with whom she had grown up were evading her; when she went to the Assembly none of them sat next to her unless no other seat were vacant; little groups toward which she drifted during lunch, inexplicably dissolved to re-form in another portion of the room. Sometimes a      PLUM    girl in this new group threw her a backward glance charged either with a mean amusement or with annoyance.  Angela was proud; she did not need such a hint more than once, but she was bewildered and hurt. She took stories to school to read at recess, or wan dered into the drawing laboratory and touched up her designs. Miss Barrington thought her an unusually industrious student.  And then in the middle of the term Mary Hast ings had come, a slender, well-bred girl of fifteen. She was rather stupid in her work, in fact she shone in nothing but French and good manners. Undeniably she had an air, and her accent was remarkable. The other pupils, giggling, produced certain uncouth and unheard of sounds, but Mary said in French: " No, I have lent my knife to the brother-in-law of the gardener but here is my cane," quite as though the idiotic phrase were part of an imaginary conversation which she was conducting and appreciating. " She really knows what she's talking about," little Esther Bayliss commented, and added that Mary's family had lost some money and they had had to send her to public school. But it was some time before this knowledge, dis pensed by Esther with mysterious yet absolute authenticity, became generally known. Mean while Mary was left to her own devices while the class with complete but tacit unanimity " tried her out ". Mary, unaware of this, looked with her near-sighted, slightly supercilious gaze about the room at recess and seeing only one girl, and that girl Angela, who approached in dress, manner and deportment her own rather set ideas, had taken her lunch over to the other pupil's desk and said :        " Come on, let's eat together while you tell me who everybody is."  Angela took the invitation as simply as the other had offered. " That little girl in the purplish dress is Esther Bayliss and the tall one in the thick glasses "  Mary, sitting with her back to the feeding groups, never troubled to look around. " I don't mean the girls. I expect I'll know them soon enough when I get around to it. I mean the teachers. Do you have to dig for them? " She liked Angela and she showed it plainly and directly. Her home was in some remote fastness of West Philadelphia which she could reach with comparative swiftness by taking the car at Spring Garden Street. Instead she walked half way home with her new friend, up Seventeenth Street as far as Girard Avenue where, after a final exchange of school matters and fare wells, she took the car, leaving Angela to her happy, satisfied thoughts. And presently she began to know more than happiness and satisfaction, she was knowing the extreme gratification of being the chosen companion of a popular and important girl, for Mary, although not quick at her studies, was a power in everything else. She dressed well, she had plenty of pocket money, she could play the latest marches in the gymnasium, she received a certain indefinable but flattering attention from the teachers, and she could make things " go ". The school paper was mori how to resuscitate it; she brought in advertisements from her father's business friends; she made her married sisters obtain subscriptions. Without being obtrusive or over-bearing, without conde scension and without toadying she was the leader        of her class. And with it all she stuck to Angela. She accepted popularity because it was thrust upon her, but she was friendly with Angela because the latter suited her.  Angela was happy. She had a friend and the friendship brought her unexpected advantages. She was no longer left out of groups because there could be no class plans without Mary and Mary would remain nowhere for any length of time with out Angela. So to save time and argument, and also to avoid offending the regent, Angela was always included. Not that she cared much about this, but she did like Mary; as is the way of a " fidus Achates ", she gave her friendship whole-heartedly. And it was gratifying to be in the midst of things.    In April the school magazine announced a new departure. Henceforth the editorial staff was to be composed of two representatives from each class ; of these one was to be the chief representative chosen by vote of the class, the other was to be assistant, selected by the chief. The chief represen tative, said the announcement pompously, would sit in at executive meetings and have a voice in the policy of the paper. The assistant would solicit and collect subscriptions, collect fees, re ceive and report complaints and in brief, said Esther Bayliss, " do all the dirty work ". But she coveted the position and title for all that.  Angela's class held a brief meeting after school and elected Mary Hastings as representative with out a dissenting vote. " No," said Angela holding up a last rather grimy bit of paper. " Here is          one for Esther Bayliss." Two or three of the girls giggled; everyone knew that she must have voted for herself; indeed it had been she who had insisted on taking a ballot rather than a vote by acclaim. Mary was already on her feet. She had been sure of the result of the election, would have been astonished indeed had it turned out any other way. " Well, girls," she began in her rather high, refined voice, " I wish to thank you for the er confidence you have bestowed, that is, placed in me and I'm sure you all know I'll do my best to keep the old paper going. And while I'm about it I might just as well announce that I'm choosing Angela Murray for my assistant."  There was a moment's silence. The girls who had thought about it at all had known that if Mary were elected, as assuredly she would be, this meant also the election of Angela. And those who had taken no thought saw no reason to object to her appointment. And anyway there was nothing to be done. But Esther Bayliss pushed forward: " I don't know how it is with the rest of you, but I should have to think twice before I'd trust my subscription money to a coloured girl."  Mary said in utter astonishment: " Coloured, why what are you talking about? Who's col oured? "  " Angela, Angela Murray, that's who's coloured. At least she used to be when we all went to school at Eighteenth and Oxford."  Mary said again: "Coloured!" And then, " Angela, you never told me you were coloured ! "  Angela's voice was as amazed as her own: " Tell you that I was coloured ! Why of course I never told you that I was coloured! Why should I? "        ;c There," said Esther, " see she never told Mary that she was coloured. What wouldn't she have done with our money ! "    Angela had picked up her books and strolled out the door. But she flew down the north stair case and out the Brandywine Street entrance and so to Sixteenth Street where she would meet no one she knew, especially at this belated hour. At home there would be work to do, her lessons to get and the long, long hours of the night must pass before she would have to face again the hurt and humiliation of the classroom; before she would have to steel her heart and her nerves to drop Mary Hastings before Mary Hastings could drop her. No one, no one, Mary least of all, should guess how completely she had been wounded. Mary and her shrinking bewilder ment! Mary and her exclamation: " Coloured! " This was a curious business, this colour. It was the one god apparently to whom you could sacri fice everything. On account of it her mother had neglected to greet her own husband on the street. Mary Hastings could let it come between her and her friend.  In the morning she was at school early; the girls should all see her there and their individual attitude should be her attitude. She would remem ber each one's greetings, would store it away for future guidance. Some of the girls were especially careful to speak to her, one or two gave her a meaning smile, or so she took it, and turned away. Some did not speak at all. When Mary Hastings        came in Angela rose and sauntered unseeing and unheeding deliberately past her through the doorway, across the hall to Miss Barrington's laboratory. As she returned she passed Mary's desk, and the girl lifted troubled but not un friendly eyes to meet her own; Angela met the glance fully but without recognition. She thought to herself: " Coloured ! If they had said to me Mary Hastings is a voodoo, I'd have answered, ' What of.it? She's my friend.' "    Before June Mary Hastings came up to her and asked her to wait after school. Angela who had been neither avoiding nor seeking her gave a cool nod. They walked out of the French class room together. When they reached the corner Mary spoke:  " Oh, Angela, let's be friends again. It doesn't really make any difference. See, I don't care any more."  " But that's what I don't understand. Why should it have made any difference in the first place? I'm just the same as I was before you knew I was coloured and just the same afterwards. Why should it ever have made any difference at all? "  " I don't know, I'm sure. I was just surprised. It was all so unexpected."  " What was unexpected? "  " Oh, I don't know. I can't explain it. But let's be friends."  " Well," said Angela slowly, " I'm willing, but I don't think it will ever be the same again."      PLUM    It wasn't. Some element, spontaneity, trustful ness was lacking. Mary, who had never thought of speaking of colour, was suddenly conscious that here was a subject which she must not dis cuss. She was less frank, at times even restrained. Angela, too young to define her thoughts, yet felt vaguely: " She failed me once, I was her friend, yet she failed me for something with which I had nothing to do. She's just as likely to do it again. It's in her."  Definitely she said to herself, " Mary with drew herself not because I was coloured but because she didn't know I was coloured. There fore if she had never known I was coloured she would always have been my friend. We would have kept on having our good times together." And she began to wonder which was the more important, a patent insistence on the fact of colour or an acceptance of the good things of life which could come to you in America if either you were not coloured or the fact of your racial connections was not made known.  During the summer Mary Hastings' family, it appeared, recovered their fallen fortunes. At any rate she did not return to school in the fall and Angela never saw her again.      VIRGINIA came rushing in. " Angela, where's Mummy? "  " Out. What's all the excitement? " " I've been appointed. Isn't it great? Won't Mother and Dad be delighted! Right at the beginning of the year too, so I won't have to wait. The official notice isn't out yet but I know it's all right. Miss Herren wants me to report to morrow. Isn't it perfectly marvellous! Here I graduate from the Normal in June and in the second week of school in September I've got my perfectly good job. Darling child, it's very much better, as you may have heard me observe before, to be born lucky than rich. But I am lucky and I'll be rich too. Think of that salary for my very own ! With both of us working, Mummy won't have to want for a thing, nor Father either. Mummy won't have to do a lick of work if she doesn't want to. Well, what have you got to say about it, old Rain-in-the-Face? Or perhaps this isn't Mrs. Henrietta Jones whom I'm addressing of?"  Angela giggled, then raised an imaginary lorgnette. " Er, really I think you have the advantage of me. Well, I was thinking how fortunate you were to get your appointment right off the bat and how you'll hate it now that you have got it."        She herself, appointed two years previously, had had no such luck. Strictly speaking there are no coloured schools as such in Philadelphia. Yet, by an unwritten law, although coloured children may be taught by white teachers, white children must never receive knowledge at the hands of coloured instructors. As the number of coloured Normal School graduates is steadily increasing, the city gets around this difficulty by manning a school in a district thickly populated by Negroes, with a coloured principal and a coloured teaching force. Coloured children living in that district must thereupon attend that school. But no attention is paid to the white children who leave this same district for the next nearest white or " mixed " school.  Angela had been sixth on the list of coloured graduates. Five had been appointed, but there was no vacancy for her, and for several months she was idle with here and there a day, perhaps a week of substituting. She could not be appointed in any but a coloured school, and she was not supposed to substitute in any but this kind of classroom. Then her father discovered that a young white woman was teaching in a coloured school. He made some searching inquiries and was met with the complacent rejoinder that as soon as a vacancy occurred in a white school, Miss Mc- Sweeney would be transferred there and his daughter could have her place.  Just as she had anticipated, Angela did not want the job after she received it. She had expected to loathe teaching little children and her expecta tion, it turned out, was perfectly well grounded. Perhaps she might like to teach drawing to grown-  ups; she would certainly like to have a try at it. Meanwhile it was nice to be independent, to be holding a lady-like, respectable position so different from her mother's early days, to be able to have pretty clothes and to help with the house, in brief to be drawing an appreciably adequate and steady salary. For one thing it made it possible for her to take up work at the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts at Broad and Cherry.    Jinny was in excellent spirits at dinner. " Now, Mummy darling, you really shall walk in silk attire and siller hae to spare." Angela's appoint ment had done away with the drudgery of washday. " We'll get Hettie Daniels to come in Saturdays and clean up. I won't have to scrub the front steps any more and everything will be feasting and fun." Pushing aside her plate she rushed over to her father, climbed on his knee and flung her lovely bronze arms around his neck. She still adored him, still thought him the finest man in the world; she still wanted her husband to be just exactly like him; he would not be so tall nor would he be quite as dark. Matthew Henson was of only medium height and was a sort of reddish yellow and he distinctly was not as handsome as her father. Indeed Virginia thought, with a pang of shame at her disloyalty, that it would have been a fine thing if he could exchange his lighter skin for her father's colour if in so doing it he might have gained her father's thick, coarsely grained but beautifully curling, open black hair. Matthew had inherited his father's  D      thick, tight, " bad " hair. Only, thank heaven, it was darker.  Junius tucked his slender daughter back in the hollow of his arm.  ' Well, baby, you want something off my plate? " As a child Virginia had been a notorious beggar.  " Darling ! I was thinking that now you could buy Mr. Hallowell's car. He's got his eye on a Cadillac, Kate says, and he'd be willing to let Henry Ford go for a song."  Junius was pleased, but he thought he ought to protest. " Do I look as old as all that? I might be able to buy the actual car, now that my girls are getting so monied, but the upkeep, I under stand, is pretty steep."  " Oh, nonsense," said Mattie. " Go on and get it, June. Think how nice it will be riding out North Broad Street in the evenings."  And Angela added kindly: " I think you owe it to yourself to get it, Dad. Jinny and I'll carry the house till you get it paid for."  " Well, there's no reason of course why I "  he corrected himself, " why we shouldn't have a car if we want it." He saw himself spending happy moments digging in the little car's inmost mysteries. He would buy new parts, change the engine perhaps, paint it and overhaul her gener ally. And he might just as well indulge himself. The little house was long since paid for; he was well insured, and his two daughters were grown up and taking care of themselves. He slid Jinny off his knee.  " I believe I'll run over to the Hallowells now and see what Tom'll take for that car. Catch him before he goes down town in it."      Virginia called after him. " Just think ! May be this time next week you'll be going down town    n t."    She was very happy. Life was turning out just right. She was young, she was twenty, she was about to earn her own living, " to be about to live " she said, happily quoting a Latin con struction which had always intrigued her. Her mother would never have to work again; her father would have a Henry Ford ; she herself would get a new, good music teacher and would also take up the study of methods at the University of Pennsylvania.  Angela could hear her downstairs talking to Matthew Henson whose ring she had just answered. " Only think, Matt, I've been appointed."  " Great ! " said Matthew. " Is Angela in? Do you think she'd like to go to the movies with me to-night? She was too tired last time. Run up and ask her, there's a good girl."  Angela sighed. She didn't want to go out with Matthew; he wearied her so. And besides people always looked at her so strangely. She wished he would take it into his head to come and see Jinny.    Sunday was still a happy day. Already an air of prosperity, of having arrived beyond the striv ing point, had settled over the family. Mr. Murray's negotiations with Tom Hallowell had been most successful. The Ford, a little four seater coupe, compact and sturdy, had changed      hands. Its former owner came around on Sunday to give Junius a lesson. The entire household piled in, for both girls were possessed of the modern slenderness. They rode out Jefferson Street and far, far out Ridge Avenue to the Wissahickon and on to Chestnut Hill. From time to time, when the traffic was thin, Junius took the wheel, anticipating Tom's instructions with the readiness of the born mechanic. They came back laughing and happy and pardonably proud. The dense, tender glow of the late afternoon September sun flooded the little parlour, the dining-room was dusky and the kitchen was redolent of scents of ginger bread and spiced preserves. After supper there were no lessons to get. " It'll be years before I forget all that stuff I learned in practice school," said Jinny gaily.  Later on some boys came in; Matthew Henson inevitably, peering dissatisfied through the autumn gloom for Angela and immediately content when he saw her; Arthur Sawyer, who had just entered the School of Pedagogy and was a little ashamed of it, for he considered teaching work fit only for women. " But I've got to make a living somehow, ain't I? And I won't go into that post-office! "  " What's the matter with the post-office? " Henson asked indignantly. He had just been appointed. In reality he did not fancy the work himself, but he did not want it decried before Angela.  " Tell me what better or surer job is there for a 'coloured man in Philadelphia? "  " Nothing," said Sawyer promptly, " not a thing in the world except school teaching. But that's just what I object to. I'm sick of planning my        life with regard to being coloured. I'm not a bit ashamed of my race. I don't mind in the least that once we were slaves. Every race in the world has at some time occupied a servile position. But I do mind having to take it into consideration every time I want to eat outside of my home, every time I enter a theatre, every time I think of a profession.  " But you do have to take it into consideration," said Jinny softly. " At present it's one of the facts of our living, just as lameness or near-sightedness might be for a white man."  The inevitable race discussion was on.  " Ah, but there you're all off, Miss Virginia." A tall, lanky, rather supercilious youth spoke up from the corner. He had been known to them all their lives as Franky Porter, but he had taken lately to publishing poems in the Philadelphia Tri " Really you're all off, for you speak as though colour itself were a deformity. Whereas, as Miss Angela being an artist knows, colour may really be a very beautiful thing, mayn't it? "  " Oh don't drag me into your old discussion," Angela answered crossly. "I'm sick of this whole race business if you ask me. And don't call me Miss Angela. Call me Angela as you've all done all our lives or else call me Miss Murray. No, I don't think being coloured in America is a beautiful thing. I think it's nothing short of a curse."  " Well," said Porter slowly, " I think its being or not being a curse rests with you. You've got to decide whether or not you're going to let it interfere with personal development and to that extent it may be harmful or it may be an incentive,          I take it that Sawyer here, who even when we were all kids always wanted to be an engineer, will transmute his colour either into a bane or a blessing according to whether he lets it make him hide his natural tendencies under the bushel of school- teaching or become an inspiration toward making him the very best kind of engineer that there ever was so that people will just have to take him for what he is and overlook the fact of colour."  " That's it," said Jinny. " You know, being coloured often does spur you on."  " And that's what I object to," Angela answered perversely. "I'm sick of this business of always being below or above a certain norm. Doesn't anyone think that we have a right to be happy simply, naturally? "    Gradually they drifted into music. Virginia played a few popular songs and presently the old beautiful airs of all time, " Drink to me only with thine eyes " and " Sweet and Low ". Arthur Sawyer had a soft, melting tenor and Angela a rather good alto; Virginia and the other boys carried the air while Junius boomed his deep, unyielding bass. The lovely melodies and the peace of the happy, tranquil household crept over them, and presently they exchanged farewells and the young men passed wearied and contented out into the dark confines of Opal Street. Angela and Mattie went upstairs, but Viginia and her father stayed below and sang very softly so as not to disturb the sleeping street; a few hymns and finally the majestic strains of " The Dying Christian "        floated up. Mrs. Murray had complained of feeling [tired. " I think I'll just lie a moment on your bed, Angela, until your father comes up." But her daughter noticed that she had not relaxed, instead she was straining forward a little and Angela realized that she was trying to catch every note of her husband's virile, hearty voice.  She said, " You heard what we were all talking about before the boys left. You and father don't ever bother to discuss such matters, do you? "  Her mother seemed to strain past the sound of her voice. " Not any more; oh, of course we used to talk about such things, but you get so taken up with the problem of living, just life itself you know, that by and by being coloured or not is just one thing more or less that you have to contend with. But of course there have been times when colour was the starting point of our discussions. I remem ber how when you and Jinny were little things and she was always running to the piano and you were scribbling all over the walls, many's the time I've slapped your little fingers for that, Angela, we used to spend half the night talking about you, your father and I. I wanted you to be great artists but Junius said: ' No, we'll give them a good, plain education and set them in the way of earning a sure and honest living; then if they've got it in them to travel over all the rocks that'll be in their way as coloured girls, they'll manage, never you fear.' And he was right." The music downstairs ceased and she lay back, relaxed and drowsy. " Your father's always right."  Much of this was news to Angela, and she would have liked to learn more about those early          nocturnal discussions. But she only said, smiling, " You're still crazy about father, aren't you, darling? "  Her mother was wide awake in an instant. "Crazy! I'd give my life for him!"    The Saturday excursions were long since a thing of the past; Henry Ford had changed that. Also the extra work which the girls had taken upon themselves in addition to their teaching, Angela at the Academy, Virginia at the University, made Saturday afternoon a too sorely needed period of relaxation to be spent in the old familiar fashion. Still there were times when Angela in search of a new frock or intent on the exploration of a picture gallery asked her mother to accompany her. And at such times the two indulged in their former custom of having tea and a comfortable hour's chat in the luxurious comfort of some exclusive tea room or hotel. Mattie, older and not quite so lightly stepping in these days of comparative ease as in those other times when a week's arduous duties lay behind her, still responded joyously to the call of fashion and grooming, the air of " good living " which pervaded these places. Moreover she herself was able to contribute to this atmos phere. Her daughters insisted on presenting her with the graceful and dainty clothes which she loved, and they were equally insistent on her wearing them. " No use hanging them in a closet," said Jinny blithely. All her prophecies had come true her mother had the services of a maid whenever she needed them, she went clad          for the most part " in silk attire ", and she had " siller to spare " and to spend.  She was down town spending it now. The Ladies' Auxiliary of her church was to give a recep tion after Lent, and Mattie meant to hold her own with the best of them. " We're getting to be old ladies," she said a bit wistfully, " but we'll make you young ones look at us once or twice just the same." Angela replied that she was sure of that. " And I know one or two little secrets for the complexion that will make it impossible for you to call yourself old."  But those her mother knew already. However she expressed a willingness to accept Angela's offer. She loved to be fussed over, and of late Angela had shown a tendency to rival even Jinny in this particular. The older girl was beginning to lose some of her restlessness. Life was pretty hum-drum, but it was comfortable and pleasant; her family life was ideal and her time at the art school delightful. The instructor was interested in her progress, and one or two of the girls had shown a desire for real intimacy. These intima tions she had not followed up very closely, but she was seeing enough of a larger, freer world to make her chafe less at the restrictions which somehow seemed to bind in her own group. As a result of even this slight satisfaction of her cravings, she was indulging less and less in brooding and intro spection, although at no time was she able to adapt herself to living with the complete spontaneity so characteristic of Jinny.  But she was young, and life would somehow twist and shape itself to her subsconscious yearnings, just as it had done for her mother, she thought,        following Mattie in and out of shops, delivering opinions and lending herself to all the exigencies which shopping imposed. It was not an occupation which she particularly enjoyed, but, like her mother, she adored the atmosphere and its accom paniment of well-dressed and luxuriously stationed women. No one could tell, no one would have thought for a moment that she and her mother had come from tiny Opal Street; no one could have dreamed of their racial connections. " And if Jinny were here," she thought, slowly selecting another cake, " she really would be just as capable of fitting into all this as mother and I ; but they wouldn't let her light." And again she let herself dwell on the fallaciousness of a social system which stretched appearance so far beyond being.  From the tea-room they emerged into the damp grey ness of the March afternoon. The streets were slushy and slimy; the sky above sodden and dull. Mattie shivered and thought of the Morris chair in the minute but cosy dining-room of her home. She wanted to go to the " Y " on Catherine Street and there were two calls to make far down Fifteenth. But at last all this was accom plished. " Now we'll get the next car and before you know it you'll be home."  c You look tired, Mother," said Angela.  " I am tired," she acknowledged, and, suddenly sagging against her daughter, lost consciousness. About them a small crowd formed, and a man passing in an automobile kindly drove the two women to a hospital in Broad Street two blocks away. It was a hospital to which no coloured woman would ever have been admitted except to char, but there was no such question to be raised          in the case of this patient. " She'll be all right presently," the interne announced, "just a little fainting spell brought on by over-exertion. Was that your car you came in? It would be nice if you could have one to get her home in."  " Oh, but I can," and in a moment Angela had rushed to the telephone forgetting everything except that her father was in his shop to-day and therefore almost within reach and so was the car.  Not long after he came striding into the hospital, tall and black and rather shabby in his working clothes. He was greeted by the clerk with a rather hostile, " Yes, and what do you want? "  Angela, hastening across the lobby to him, halted at the intonation.  Junius was equal to the moment's demands. " I'm Mrs. Murray's chauffeur," he announced, hating the deception, but he would not have his wife off, Miss Angela? "  His daughter hastened to reassure him. " No, she'll be down in a few minutes now."  " And meanwhile you can wait outside," said the attendant icily. She did not believe that black people were exactly human; there was no place for them in the scheme of life so far as she could see.  Junius withdrew, and in a half hour's time the young interne and the nurse came out supporting his wan wife. He sprang to the pavement: "Lean on me, Mrs. Murray."  But sobbing, she threw her arms about his neck. " Oh Junius, Junius ! "  He lifted her then, drew back for Angela and mounting himself, drove away. The interne        stepped back into the hospital raging about these damn white women and their nigger servants. Such women ought to be placed in a psycho-pathic ward and the niggers burned.    The girls got Mrs. Murray into the Morris chair and ran upstairs for pillows and wraps. When they returned Junius was in the chair and Mrs. Murray in his arms. " Oh, June, dear June, such a service of love."  " Do you suppose she's going to die? " whispered Jinny, stricken. What, she wondered, would become of her father.  But in a few days Mattie was fully recovered and more happy than ever in the reflorescence of love and tenderness which had sprung up between herself and Junius. Only Junius was not so well. He had had a slight touch of grippe during the winter and the half hour's loitering in the treach erous March weather, before the hospital, had not served to improve it. He was hoarse and feverish, though this he did not immediately admit. But a tearing pain in his chest compelled him one morning to suggest the doctor. In a panic Mattie sent for him. Junius really ill ! She had never seen him in anything but the pink of condition. The doctor reluctantly admitted pneumonia " a severe case but I think we can pull him through."  He suffered terribly Mattie suffered with him, never leaving his bedside. On the fifth day he was delirious. His wife thought, " Surely God isn't going to let him die without speaking to me again."          Toward evening he opened his eyes and saw her tender, stricken face. He smiled. " Dear Mattie," and then, "Jinny, I'd like to hear some music, 'Vital spark '-  So his daughter went down to the little parlour and played and sang " The Dying Christian ".  Angela thought, " Oh, isn't this terrible ! Oh how can she? " Presently she called softly, "Jinny, Jinny come up."  Junius' hand was groping for Mattie's. She placed it in his. " Dear Mattie," he said, " Heaven opens on my eyes, -- "    The house was still with the awful stillness that follows a funeral. All the bustle and hurry were over; the end, the fulfilment toward which the family had been striving for the last three days was accomplished. The baked funeral meats had been removed; Virginia had seen to that. Angela was up in her room, staring dry-eyed before her; she loved her father, but not even for him could she endure this aching, formless pain of bereavement. She kept saying to herself fiercely : " I must get over this, I can't stand this. I'll go away."  Mrs. Murray sat in the old Morris chair in the dining-room. She stroked its arms with her plump, worn fingers; she laid her face again and again on its shabby back. One knew that she was remembering a dark, loved cheek. Jinny said, " Come upstairs and let me put you to bed, darling. You're going to sleep with me, you know. You're going to comfort your little girl, aren't you,          Mummy? " Then as there was no response, " Darling, you'll make yourself ill."  Her mother sat up suddenly. " Yes, that's what I want to do. Oh, Jinny, do you think I can make myself ill enough to follow him soon? My daughter, try to forgive me, but I must go to him. I can't live without him. I don't deserve a daughter like you, but, don't let them hold me back. I want to die, I must die. Say you for give me, -- "  " Darling," and it was as though her husband rather than her daughter spoke, " whatever you want is what I want." By a supreme effort she held back her tears, but it was years before she forgot the picture of her mother sitting back in the old Morris chair, composing herself for death.  AT the Academy matters progressed smoothly without the flawing of a ripple. Angela looked forward to the hours which she spent there and honestly regretted their passage. Her fellow students and the instructors were more than cordial, there was an actual sense of camaraderie among them. She had not mentioned the fact of her Negro strain, indeed she had no occasion to, but she did not believe that this fact if known would cause any change in attitude. Artists were noted for their broad-mindedness. They were the first persons in the world to judge a person for his worth rather than by any hall-mark. It is true that Miss Henderson, a young lady of undeniable colour, was not received with the same cordiality and attention which Angela was receiving, and this, too, despite the fact that the former's work showed undeniable talent, even originality. Angela thought that something in the young lady's personality precluded an approach to friendship; she seemed to be wary, almost offen sively stand-offish. Certainly she never spoke unless spoken to; she had been known to spend a whole session without even glancing at a [fellow student.  Angela herself had not arrived at any genuine intimacies. Two of the girls had asked her to their  homes but she had always refused; such invitations would have to be returned with similar ones and the presence of Jinny would entail explanations. The invitation of Mr. Shields, the instructor, to have tea at his wife's at home was another matter and of this she gladly availed herself. She could not tell to just what end she was striving. She did not like teaching and longed to give it up. On the other hand she must make her living. Mr. Shields had suggested that she might be able to increase both her earning capacity and her enjoyments through a more practical application of her art. There were directorships of drawing in the public schools, positions in art schools and colleges, or, since Angela frankly acknowledged her unwill ingness to instruct, there was such a thing as being buyer for the art section of a department store.  " And anyway," said Mrs. Shields, " you never know what may be in store for you if you just have preparation." She and her husband were both attracted to the pleasant-spoken, talented girl. Angela possessed an undeniable air, and she dressed well, even superlatively. Her parents' death had meant the possession of half the house and half of three thousand dollars' worth of insur ance. Her salary was adequate, her expenses light. Indeed even her present mode of living gave her little cause for complaint except that her racial affiliations narrowed her confines. But she was restlessly conscious of a desire for broader horizons. She confided something like this to her new friends.  " Perfectly natural," they agreed. " There's no telling where your tastes and talents will lead you,        to Europe perhaps and surely to the formation of new and interesting friendships. You'll find artistic folk the broadest, most liberal people in the world."  " There are possibilities of scholarships, too," Mr. Shields concluded more practically. The Academy offered a few in competition. But there were others more liberally endowed and practically without restriction.    Sundays on Opal Street bore still their aspect of something different and special. Jinny sometimes went to church, sometimes packed the car with a group of laughing girls of her age and played at her father's old game of exploring. Angela preferred to stay in the house. She liked to sleep late, get up for a leisurely bath and a meticulous toilet. Afterwards she would turn over her wardrobe, sorting and discarding; read the week's forecast of theatres, concerts and exhibits. And finally she would begin sketching, usually ending up with a new view of Hetty Daniels' head.  Hetty, who lived with them now in the triple capacity, as she saw it, of housekeeper, companion, and chaperone, loved to pose. It satisfied some unquenchable vanity in her unloved, empty exist ence. She could not conceive of being sketched because she was, in the artist's jargon, " interest ing", "paintable", or "difficult". Models, as she understood it, were chosen for their beauty. Square and upright she sat, regaling Angela with tales of the romantic adventures of some remote      period which was her youth. She could not be very old, the young girl thought; indeed, from some of her dates she must have been at least twelve years younger than her mother. Yet Mrs. Murray had carried with her to the end some irrefragable quality of girlishness which would keep her memory forever young.  Miss Daniels' great fetish was sex morality. " Them young fellers was always 'round me thick ez bees; wasn't any night they wasn't more fellows in my kitchen then you an' Jinny ever has in yore parlour. But I never listened to none of the' talk, jist held out agin 'em and kept my pearl of great price untarnished. I aimed then and I'm continual to aim to be a verjous woman."  Her unslaked yearnings gleamed suddenly out of her eyes, transforming her usually rather expres sionless face into something wild and avid. The dark brown immobile mask of her skin made an excellent foil for the vividness of an emotion which was so apparent, so palpable that it seemed like something superimposed upon the background of her countenance.  " If I could just get that look for Mr. Shields," Angela said half aloud to herself, " I bet I could get any of their old scholarships. ... So you had lots more beaux than we have, Hetty? Well you wouldn't have to go far to outdo us there."  The same half dozen young men still visited the Murray household on Sundays. None of them except Matthew Henson came as a suitor; the others looked in partly from habit, partly, Jinny used to say, for the sake of Hetty Daniels' good      ginger bread, but more than for any other reason for the sake of having a comfortable place in which to argue and someone with whom to conduct the argument.  "They certainly do argue;" Angela grumbled a little, but she didn't care. Matthew was usually the leader in their illimitable discussions, but she much preferred him at this than at his clumsy and distasteful love-making. Of course she could go out, but there was no place for her to visit and no companions for her to visit with. If she made calls there would be merely a replica of what she was finding in her own household. It was true that in the ultra-modern set Sunday dancing was being taken up. But she and Virginia did not fit in here any too well. Her fancy envisaged a comfortable drawing-room (there were folks who used that term), peopled with distinguished men and women who did things, wrote and painted and acted, people with a broad, cultural background behind them, or, lacking that, with the originality of thought and speech which comes from failing, deliberately failing, to conform to the pattern. Somewhere, she supposed, there must be coloured people like that. But she didn't know any of them. She knew there were people right in Philadelphia who had left far, far behind them the economic class to which her father and mother had belonged. But their thoughts, their actions were still cramped and confined; they were sitting in their new, even luxurious quarters, still mental parvenus, still dis cussing the eternal race question even as these boys here.  To-night they were hard at it again with/a new phase which Angela, who usually sat only half        attentive in their midst, did not remember ever having heard touched before. Seymour Porter had started the ball by forcing their attention to one of his poems. It was not a bad poem; as modern verse goes it possessed a touch distinctly above the mediocre.  " Why don't you stop that stuff and get down to brass tacks, Porter? " Matthew snarled. " You'll be of much more service to your race as a good dentist than as a half-baked poet." Henson happened to know that the amount of study which the young poet did at the Univer sity kept him just barely registered in the dental college.  Porter ran his hand over his beautifully groomed hair. He had worn a stocking cap in his room all the early part of the day to enable him to perform this gesture without disaster. " There you go, Henson, service to the race and all the rest of it. Doesn't it ever occur to you that the race is made up of individuals and you can't conserve the good of the whole unless you establish that of each part? Is it better for me to be a first rate dentist and be a cabined and confined personality or a half-baked poet, as you'd call it, and be myself? "  Henson reasoned that a coloured American must take into account that he is usually living in a hostile community. " If you're only a half-baked poet they'll think that you're a representative of your race and that we're all equally no account. But if you're a fine dentist, they won't think, it's true, that we're all as skilled as you, but they will respect you and concede that probably there're a few more like          you. Inconsistent, but that's the way they argue."  Arthur Sawyer objected to this constant yield ing to an invisible censorship. " If you're coloured you've just got to straddle a bit; you've got to consider both racial and individual integrity. I've got to be sure of a living right now. So in order not to bring the charge of vagrancy against my family I'm going to teach until I've saved enough money to study engineering in comfort."  " And when you get through? " Matthew asked politely.  " When I get through, if this city has come to its senses, I'll get a big job with Baldwin. If not I'll go to South America and take out naturaliza tion papers."  " But you can't do that," cried Jinny, " we'd need you more than ever if you had all that train ing. You know what I think? We've all of us got to make up our minds to the sacrifice of some thing. I mean something more than just the ordin ary sacrifices in life, not so much for the sake of the next generation as for the sake of some prin ciple, for the sake of some immaterial quality like pride or intense self-respect or even a saving com placency; a spiritual tonic which the race needs perhaps just as much as the body might need iron or whatever it does need to give the proper kind of resistance. There are some things which an individual might want, but which he'd just have to give up forever for the sake of the more im portant whole."  " It beats me," said Sawyer indulgently, " how a little thing like you can catch hold of such a          big thought. I don't know about a man's giving up his heart's desire forever, though, just because he's coloured. That seems to me a pretty large order."  " Large order or not," Henson caught him up, " she comes mighty near being right. What do you think, Angela? "  "Just the same as I've always thought. I don't see any sense in living unless you're going to be happy."    Angela took the sketch of Hetty Daniels to school. " What an interesting type ! " said Ger trude Quale, the girl next to her. " Such cosmic and tragic unhappiness in that face. What is she, not an American? "  " Oh yes she is. She's an old coloured woman who's worked in our family for years and she was born right here in Philadelphia."  " Oh coloured ! Well, of course I suppose you would call her an American though I never think of darkies as Americans. Coloured, yes that would account for that unhappi ness in her face. I suppose they all mind it awfully."  It was the afternoon for the life class. The model came in, a short, rather slender young woman with a faintly pretty, shrewish face full of a certain dark, mean character. Angela glanced at her thoughtfully, full of pleasant anticipation. She liked to work for character, preferred it even to beauty. The model caught her eye, looked away and again turned her full gaze upon her with          an insistent, slightly incredulous stare. It was Esther Bayliss who had once been in the High School with Angela. She had left not long after Mary Hastings' return .to her boarding school.  Angela saw no reason why she should speak to her and presently, engrossed in the portrayal of the round, yet pointed little face, forgot the girl's identity. But Esther kept her eyes fixed on her former school-mate with a sort of intense, angry brooding so absorbing that she forgot her pose and Mr. Shield spoke to her two or three times. On the third occasion he said not un kindly, " You'll have to hold your pose better than this, Miss Bayliss, or we won't be able to keep you on."  " I don't want you to keep me on." She spoke with an amazing vindictiveness. " I haven't got to the point yet where I'm going to lower myself to pose for a coloured girl."  He looked around the room in amazement; no, Miss Henderson wasn't there, she never came to this class he remembered. " Well after that we couldn't keep you anyway. We're not taking orders from our models. But there's no coloured girl here."  " Oh yes there is, unless she's changed her name." She laughed spitefully. " Isn't that An gela Murray over there next to that Jew girl? " In spite of himself, Shields nodded. " Well, she's coloured though she wouldn't let you know. But I know. I went to school with her in North Philadelphia. And I tell you I wouldn't stay to pose for her not if you were to pay me ten times what I'm getting. Sitting there drawing      from me just as though she were as good as a white girl ! "  Astonished and disconcerted, he told his wife about it. " But I can't think she's really coloured, Mabel. Why she looks and acts just like a white girl. She dresses in better taste than anybody in the room. But that little wretch of a model insisted that she was coloured."  " Well she just can't be. Do you suppose I don't know a coloured woman when I see one? I can tell 'em a mile off."  It seemed to him a vital and yet such a dis graceful matter. " If she is coloured she should have told me. I'd certainly like to know, but hang it all, I can't ask her, for suppose she should be white in spite of what that little beast of a model said? " He found her address in the registry and overcome one afternoon with shamed curiosity drove up to Opal Street and slowly past her house. Jinny was coming in from school and Hetty Daniels on her way to market greeted her on the lower step. Then Virginia put the key in the lock and passed inside. " She is coloured," he told his wife, " for no white girl in her senses would be rooming with coloured people."  " I should say not ! Coloured, is she? Well, she shan't come here again, Henry."  Angela approached him after class on Satur day. " How is Mrs. Shields? I can't get out to see her this week but I'll be sure to run in next."  He blurted out miserably, " But, Miss Murray, you never told me that you were coloured."  She felt as though she were rehearsing a well-known part in a play. " Coloured ! Of          course I never told you that I was coloured. Why should I?"    But apparently there was some reason why she should tell it; she sat in her room in utter dejection trying to reason it out. Just as in the old days she had not discussed the matter with Jinny, for what could the latter do? She wondered if her mother had ever met with any such experi ences. Was there something inherently wrong in "passing"?  Her mother had never seemed to consider it as anything but a lark. And on the one occasion, that terrible day in the hospital when passing or not passing might have meant the difference between good will and unpleasantness, her mother had deliberately given the whole show away. But her mother, she had long since begun to realize, had not considered this business of colour or the lack of it as pertaining intimately to her personal happiness. She was perfectly satisfied, absolutely content whether she was part of that white world with Angela or up on little Opal Street with her dark family and friends. Where as it seemed to Angela that all the things which she most wanted were wrapped up with white people. All the good things were theirs. Not, some coldly reasoning instinct within was say ing, because they were white. But because for the present they had power and the badge of that power was whiteness, very like the colours on the escutcheon of a powerful house. She possessed the badge, and unless there was          someone to tell she could possess the power for which it stood.  Hetty Daniels shrilled up: " Mr. Henson's down here to see you."  Tiresome though his presence was, she almost welcomed him to-night, and even accepted his eager invitation to go to see a picture. " It's in a little gem of a theatre, Angela. You'll like the surroundings almost as much as the picture, and that's very good. Sawyer and I saw it about two weeks ago. I thought then that I'd like to take you."  She knew that this was his indirect method of telling her that they would meet with no difficulty in the matter of admission ; a comforting assurance, for Philadelphia theatres, as Angela knew, could be very unpleasant to would-be coloured patrons. Henson offered to telephone for a taxi while she was getting on her street clothes, and she permitted the unnecessary extravagance, for she hated the conjectures on the faces of passengers in the street cars; conjectures, she felt in her sensitiveness, which she could only set right by being unusually kind and friendly in her manner to Henson. And this produced undesirable effects on him. She had gone out with him more often in the Ford, which permitted a modicum of privacy. But Jinny was off in the little car to-night.  At Broad and Ridge Avenue the taxi was held up ; it was twenty-five minutes after eight when they reached the theatre. Matthew gave Angela a bill. " Do you mind getting the tickets while I settle for the cab? " he asked nervously. He did not want her to miss even the advertisements. This, he almost prayed, would be a perfect night.        Cramming the change into his pocket, he rushed into the lobby and joined Angela who, almost as excited as he, for she liked a good picture, handed the tickets to the attendant. He returned the stubs. " All right, good seats there to your left." The theatre was only one storey. He glanced at Matthew.  " Here, here, where do you think you're going? "  Matthew answered unsuspecting: " It's all right. The young lady gave you the tickets."  " Yes, but not for you; she can go in, but you can't." He handed him the torn ticket, turned and took one of the stubs from Angela, and thrust that in the young man's unwilling hand. " Go over there and get your refund."  " But," said Matthew and Angela could feel his very manhood sickening under the silly humiliation of the moment, " there must be some mistake; I sat in this same theatre less than three weeks ago."  ' Well, you won't sit in there to-night; the management's changed hands since then, and we're not selling tickets to coloured people." He glanced at Angela a little uncertainly. " The young lady can come in "  Angela threw her ticket on the floor. " Oh, come Matthew, come."  Outside he said stiffly, " I'll get a taxi, we'll go somewhere else."  " No, no ! We wouldn't enjoy it. Let's go home and we don't need a taxi. We can get the Sixteenth Street car right at the            She was very kind to him in the car; she was so sorry for him, suddenly conscious of the pain which must be his at being stripped before the girl he loved of his masculine right to protect, to appear the hero.  She let him open the two doors for her but stopped him in the box of a hall. " I think I'll say good-night now, Matthew; I'm more tired than I realized. But, but it was an adventure, wasn't it? "  His eyes adored her, his hand caught hers: " Angela, I'd have given all I hope to possess to have been able to prevent it; you know I never dreamed of letting you in for such humiliation. Oh how are we ever going to get this thing straight? "  ' Well, it wasn't your fault." Unexpectedly she lifted her delicate face to his, so stricken and freckled and woebegone, and kissed him; lifted her hand and actually stroked his reddish, stiff, " bad " hair.  Like a man in a dream he walked down the street wondering how long it would be before they married.    Angela, waking in the middle of the night and reviewing to herself the events of the day, said aloud: "This is the end," and fell asleep again.  The little back room was still Jinny's, but Angela, in order to give the third storey front to Hetty Daniels, had moved into the room which had once been her mother's. She and Virginia        had placed the respective head-boards of their narrow, virginal beds against the dividing wall so that they could lie in bed and talk to each other through the communicating door-way, their voices making a circuit from speaker to listener in what Jinny called a hair pin curve.  Angela called in as soon as she heard her sister moving, "Jinny, listen. I'm going away."  Her sister, still half asleep, lay intensely quiet for another second, trying to pick up the con tinuity of this dream. Then her senses came to her.  " What'd you say, Angela? "  " I said I was going away. I'm going to leave Philadelphia, give up school teaching, break away from our loving friends and acquaintances, and bust up the whole shooting match."  " Haven't gone crazy, have you? "  " No, I think I'm just beginning to come to my senses. I'm sick, sick, sick of seeing what I want dangled right before my eyes and then of having it snatched away from me and all of it through no fault of my own."  " Darling, you know I haven't the faintest idea of what you're driving at."  " Well, I'll tell you." Out came the whole story, an accumulation of the slights, real and fancied, which her colour had engendered through out her lifetime; though even then she did not tell of that first hurt through Mary Hastings. That would always linger in some remote, impene trable fastness of her mind, for wounded trust was there as well as wounded pride and love. " And these two last happenings with Matthew and Mr.      Shields are just too much; besides they've shown me the way."  " Shown you what way? "  Virginia had arisen and thrown an old rose kimono around her. She had inherited her father's thick and rather coarsely waving black hair, enhanced by her mother's softness. She was slender, yet rounded; her cheeks were flushed with sleep and excitement. Her eyes shone. As she sat in the brilliant wrap, cross-legged at the foot of her sister's narrow bed, she made the latter think of a strikingly dainty, colourful robin.  " Well you see as long as the Shields thought I was white they were willing to help me to all the glories of the promised land. And the doorman last night, he couldn't tell what I was, but he could tell about Matthew, so he put him out; just as the Shields are getting ready in another way to put me out. But as long as they didn't know it didn't matter. Which means it isn't being coloured that makes the difference, it's letting it be known. Do you see?  " So I've thought and thought. I guess really I've had it in my mind for a long time, but last night it seemed to stand right out in my con sciousness. Why should I shut myself off from all the things I want most, clever people, people who do things, Art, " her voice spelt it with a capital, " travel and a lot of things which are in the world for everybody really but which only white people, as far as I can see, get their hands on. I mean scholarships and special funds, patronage. Oh Jinny, you don't know, I don't think you can understand the things I want to see and know. You're not like me ".        " I don't know why I'm not," said Jinny looking more like a robin than ever. Her bright eyes dwelt on her sister. " After all, the same blood flows in my veins and in the same propor tion. Sure you're not laying too much stress on something only temporarily inconvenient? "  " But it isn't temporarily inconvenient; it's happening to me every day. And it isn't as though it were something that I could help. Look how Mr. Shields stressed the fact that I hadn't told him I was coloured. And see how it changed his attitude toward me; you can't think how different his manner was. Yet as long as he didn't know, there was nothing he wasn't willing and glad, glad to do for me. Now he might be willing but he'll not be glad though I need his assistance more than some white girl who will find a dozen people to help her just because she is white." Some faint disapproval in her sister's face halted her for a moment. " What's the matter? You certainly don't think I ought to say first thing: ' I'm Angela Murray. I know I look white but I'm coloured and expect to be treated accordingly ! ' Now do you? "  " No," said Jinny, " of course that's absurd. Only I don't think you ought to mind quite so hard when they do find out the facts. It seems sort of an insult to yourself. And then, too, it makes you lose a good chance to do something for for all of us who can't look like you but who really have the same combination of blood that you have."  " Oh that's some more of your and Matthew Henson's philosophy. Now be practical, Jinny;          after all I am both white and Negro and look white. Why shouldn't I declare for the one that will bring me the greatest happiness, prosperity and respect? "  " No reason in the world except that since in this country public opinion is against any infusion of black blood it would seem an awfully decent thing to put yourself, even in the face of appear ances, on the side of black blood and say: " Look here, this is what a mixture of black and white really means ! "  Angela was silent and Virginia, feeling suddenly very young, almost childish in the presence of this issue, took a turn about the room. She halted beside her sister.  "Just what is it you want to do, Angela? Evidently you have some plan."  She had. Her idea was to sell the house and to divide the proceeds. With her share of this and her half of the insurance she would go to New York or to Chicago, certainly to some place where she could by no chance be known, and launch out " into a freer, fuller life ".  " And leave me ! " said Jinny astonished. Some how it had not dawned on her that the two would actually separate. She did not know what she had thought, but certainly not that. The tears ran down her cheeks.  Angela, unable to endure either her own pain or the sight of it in others, had all of a man's dislike for tears.  " Don't be absurd, Jinny ! How could I live the way I want to if you're with me. We'd keep on loving each other and seeing one another from          time to time, but we might just as well face the facts. Some of those girls in the art school used to ask me to their homes; it would have meant opportunity, a broader outlook, but I never dared accept because I knew I couldn't return the invitation."  Under that Jinny winced a little, but she spoke with spirit. " After that, Angela dear, I'm beginning to think that you have more white blood in your veins than I, and it was that extra amount which made it possible for you to make that remark." She trailed back to her room and when Hetty Daniels announced breakfast she found that a bad headache required a longer stay in bed.    For many years the memory of those next few weeks lingered in Virginia's mind beside that other tragic memory of her mother's deliberate submission to death. But Angela was almost tremulous with happiness and anticipation. Al most as though by magic her affairs were arranging themselves. She was to have the three thousand dollars and Jinny was to be the sole possessor of the house. Junius had paid far less than this sum for it, but it had undoubtedly increased in value. " It's a fair enough investment for you, Miss Virginia," Mr. Hallowell remarked gruffly. He had disapproved heartily of this summary division, would have disapproved more thoroughly and openly if he had had any idea of the reasons behind it. But the girls had told no one, not even him, of their plans. " Some sisters' quarrel ?    I suppose," he commented to his wife. " I've never seen any coloured people yet, relatives that is, who could stand the joint possession of a little money."  A late Easter was casting its charm over the city when Angela trim, even elegant, in her con ventional tailored suit, stood in the dining-room of the little house waiting for her taxi. She had burned her bridges behind her, had resigned from school, severed her connection with the Academy, and had permitted an impression to spread that she was going West to visit indefinitely a distant cousin of her mother's. In reality she was going to New York. She had covered her tracks very well, she thought ; none of her friends was to see her off; indeed, none of them knew the exact hour of her departure. She was even leaving from the North Philadelphia station so that none of the porters of the main depot, friends perhaps of the boys who came to her house, and, through some far flung communal instinct familiar to coloured people, acquainted with her by sight, would be able to tell of her going. Jinny, until she heard of this, had meant to accompany her to the station, but Angela's precaution palpably scotched this idea; she made no comment when Virginia announced that it would be impossible for her to see her sister off. An indefinable steeliness was creeping upon them.  Yet when the taxi stood rumbling and snorting outside, Angela, her heart suddenly mounting to her throat, her eyes smarting, put her arm tightly about her sister who clung to her frankly crying. But she only said: " Now, Jinny, there's nothing to cry about. You'll be coming to New York          soon. First thing I know you'll be walking up to me: 'Pardon me! Isn't this Mrs. Henrietta Jones? ' "  Virginia tried to laugh, " And you'll be saying : ( Really you have the advantage of me.' Oh, Angela, don't leave me ! "  The cabby was honking impatiently. " I must, darling. Good-bye, Virginia. You'll hear from me right away."  She ran down the steps, glanced happily back. But her sister had already closed the door.    MARKET      FIFTH AVENUE is a canyon; its towering buildings dwarf the importance of the people hurrying through its narrow confines. But Fourteenth Street is a river, impersonally flowing, broad- bosomed, with strange and devious craft covering its expanse. To Angela the famous avenue seemed but one manifestation of living, but Fourteenth Street was the rendezvous of life itself. Here for those first few weeks after her arrival in New York she wandered, almost prowled, intent upon the jostling shops, the hurrying, pushing people, above all intent upon the faces of those people with their showings of grief, pride, gaiety, greed, joy, am bition, content. There was little enough of this last. These men and women were living at a sharper pitch of intensity than those she had ob served in Philadelphia. The few coloured people whom she saw were different too; they possessed an independence of carriage, a purposefulness, an assurance in their manner that pleased her. But she could not see that any of these people, black or white, were any happier than those whom she had observed all her life.  But she was happier; she was living on the crest of a wave of excitement and satisfaction which would never wane, never break, never be spent. She was seeing the world, she was getting acquainted        with life in her own way without restrictions or restraint; she was young, she was temporarily independent, she was intelligent, she was white. She remembered an expression " free, white and twenty-one ", this was what it meant then, this sense of owning the world, this realization that other things being equal, all things were possible. " If I were a man," she said, " I could be presi dent ", and laughed at herself for the "if" itself proclaimed a limitation. But that inconsistency bothered her little; she did not want to be a man. Power, greatness, authority, these were fitting and proper for men ; but there were sweeter, more beautiful gifts for women, and power of a certain kind too. Such a power she would like to exert in this glittering new world, so full of mys teries and promise. If she could aiford it she would have a salon, a drawing-room where men and women, not necessarily great, but real, alive, free and untrammelled in manner and thought, should come and pour themselves out to her sym pathy and magnetism. To accomplish this she must have money and influence; indeed since she was so young she would need even protection; perhaps it would be better to marry ... a white man. The thought came to her suddenly out of the void; she had never thought of this possi bility before. If she were to do this, do it suitably, then all that richness, all that fullness of life which she so ardently craved would be doubly hers. She knew that men had a better time of it than women, coloured men than coloured women, white men than white women. Not that she envied them. Only it would be fun, great fun to capture power and protection in addition to the freedom and          independence which she had so long coveted and which now lay in her hand.  But, she smiled to herself, she had no way of approaching these ends. She knew no one in New York; she could conceive of no manner in which she was likely to form desirable acquaint ances; at present her home consisted of the four walls of the smallest room in Union Square Hotel She had gone there the second day after her arrival, having spent an expensive twenty-four hours at the Astor. Later she came to realize that there were infinitely cheaper habitations to be had, but she could not tear herself away from Fourteenth Street. It was Spring, and the Square was full of rusty specimens of mankind who sat on the benches, as did Angela herself, for hours at a stretch, as though they thought the invigorat ing air and the mellow sun would work some magical burgeoning on their garments such as was worked on the trees. But though these latter changed, the garments changed not nor did their owners. They remained the same, drooping, discouraged down and outers. " I am seeing life," thought Angela, " this is the way people live," and never realized that some of these people looking curiously, speculatively at her wondered what had been her portion to bring her thus early to this unsavoury company.  "A great picture!" she thought. "I'll make a great picture of these people some day and call them a vast sadness invaded her; she wondered if there were people more alive, more sentient to the jy> the adventure of living, even than she, to whom she would also be a " type ". But she        could not believe this. She was at once almost irreconcilably too concentrated and too objective. Her living during these days was so intense, so almost solidified, as though her desire to live as she did and she herself were so one and the same thing that it would have been practically im possible for another onlooker like herself to insert the point of his discrimination into her firm panoply of satisfaction. So she continued to browse along her chosen thoroughfare, stopping most often in the Square or before a piano store on the same street. There was in this shop a player-piano which was usually in action, and as the front glass had been removed the increased clearness of the strains brought a steady, patient, apparently insatiable group of listeners to a stand still. They were mostly men, and as they were far less given, Angela observed, to concealing their feelings than women, it was easy to follow their emotional gamut. Jazz made them smile but with a certain wistfulness if only they had time for dancing now, just now when the mood was on them ! The young woman looking at the gathering of shabby pedestrians, worn business men and ruminative errand boys felt for them a pity not untinged with satisfaction. She had taken what she wanted while the mood was on her. Love songs, particularly those of the sorrowful ballad variety brought to these unmindful faces a strained regret. But there was one expression which Angela could only half interpret. It drifted on to those listening countenances usually at the playing of old Irish and Scottish tunes. She noticed then an acuter attitude of attention, the eyes took on a look of inwardness of utter remote-        ness. A passer-by engrossed in thought caught a strain and at once his gait and expression fell under the spell. The listeners might be as varied as fifteen people may be, yet for the moment they would be caught in a common, almost cosmic nostalgia. If the next piece were jazz that particular crowd would disperse, its members going on their meditative ways, blessed or cursed with heaven knew what memories which must not be disturbed by the strident jangling of the latest popular song.  " Homesick," Angela used to say to herself. And she would feel so, too, though she hardly knew for what, certainly not for Philadelphia and that other life which now seemed so removed as to have been impossible. And she made notes in her sketch book to enable her some day to make a great picture of these " types " too.    Of course she was being unconscionably idle; but as her days were filled to overflowing with the impact of new impressions, this signified nothing. She could not guess what life would bring her. For the moment it seemed to her both wise and amusing to sit with idle hands and see what would happen. By a not inexplicable turn of mind she took to going very frequently to the cinema where most things did happen. She found herself studying the screen with a strained and ardent intensity, losing the slight patronizing scepticism which had once been hers with regard to the adventures of these shadowy heroes and  '      heroines; so utterly unforeseen a turn had her own experiences taken. This time last year she had never dreamed of, had^hardly dared to long for a life as free and as full as hers was now and^was promising to be. Yet here she was on the thresh- hold of a career totally different from anything that a scenario writer could envisage. Oh yes, she knew that hundreds, indeed thousands of white coloured people " went over to the other side ", but that was just the point, she knew the fact without knowing hitherto any of the possi bilities of the adventure. Already Philadelphia and her trials were receding into the distance. Would these people, she wondered, glancing about her in the soft gloom of the beautiful theatre, begrudge her, if they knew, her cherished freedom and sense of unrestraint? If she were to say to this next woman for instance, "I'm coloured," would she show the occasional dog-in-the-manger attitude of certain white Americans and refuse to sit by her or make a complaint to the usher? But she had no intention of making such an announce ment. So she spent many happy, irresponsible, amused hours in the marvellous houses on Broad way or in the dark commonplaceness of her beloved Fourteenth Street. There was a theatre, too, on Seventh Avenue just at the edge of the Village, which she came to frequent, not so much for the sake of the plays, which were the same as elsewhere, as for the sake of the audience, a curiously intimate sort of audience made of numerous still more intimate groups. Their members seemed both purposeful and leisurely, When she came here her loneliness palled on her, however. All unaware her lace took      on the wistfulness of the men gazing in the music store. She wished she knew some of these pleasant people.    It came to her that she was neglecting her Art. " And it was for that that I broke away from every thing and came to New York. I must hunt up some classes." This she felt was not quite true, then the real cause rushed up to the surface of her mind : " And perhaps I'll meet some people.'  She enrolled in one of the art classes in Cooper Union. This, after all, she felt would be the real beginning of her adventure. For here she must make acquaintances and one of them, perhaps several, must produce some effect on her life, per haps alter its whole tenor. And for the first time she would be seen, would be met against her new background or rather, against no background. No boyish stowaway on a ship had a greater exuberance in going forth to meet the unknown than had Angela as she entered her class that first after noon. In the room were five people, working steadily and chatting in an extremely desultory way. The instructor, one of the five, motioned her to a seat whose position made her one of the group. He set up her easel and as she arranged her material she glanced shyly but keenly about her. For the first time she realized how lonely she had been. She thought with a joy which surprised her self: " Within a week I'll be chatting with them too; perhaps going to lunch or to tea with one of them," She arranged herself for a better view,        The young woman nearest her, the possessor of a great mop of tawny hair and smiling clear, slate- grey eyes glanced up at her and nodded, " Am I in your way? " Except for her hair and eyes she was nondescript. A little beyond sat a coloured girl of medium height and build, very dark, very clean, very reserved. Angela, studying her with inner secret knowledge, could feel her constantly withdrawn from her companions. Her refinement was conspicuous but her reserve more so; when asked she passed and received erasers and other articles but she herself did no borrowing nor did she initiate any conversation. Her squarish head capped with a mass of unnaturally straight and unnaturally burnished hair possessed a kind of ugly beauty. Angela could not tell whether her features were good but blurred and blunted by the soft night of her skin or really ugly with an ugliness lost and plunged in that skin's deep con cealment. Two students were still slightly behind her. She wondered how she could best contrive to see them.  Someone said: "Hi, there! Miss New One, havejyow got a decent eraser? all mine are on the blink." Not so sure whether or not the term applied to herself she turned to meet the singularly intent gaze of a slender girl with blue eyes, light chestnut hair and cheeks fairly blazing with some unguessed excitement. Angela smiled and offered her eraser.  " It ought to be decent, it's new."  c Yes, it's a very good one; many thanks. I'll try not to trouble you again. My name's Paulette Lister, what's yours? "  " Angele Mory." She had changed it thus          slightly when she came to New York. Some troubling sense of loyalty to her father and mother had made it impossible for her to do away with it altogether.  " Mory," said a young man who had been working just beyond Paulette; " that's Spanish. Are you by any chance? "  " I don't think so."  " He is," said Paulette. " His name is Anthony Cruz isn't that a lovely name? But he changed it to Cross because no American would ever pronounce the z right, and he didn't want to be taken for a widow's cruse."  " That's a shameful joke," said Cross, " but since I made it up, I think you might give me a chance to spring it, Miss Lister. A poor thing but mine own. You might have a heart."  " Get even with her, why don't you, by intro ducing her as Miss Blister? " asked Angela, highly diverted by the foolish talk.  Several people came in then, and she discovered that she had been half an hour too early, the class was just beginning. She glanced about at the newcomers, a beautiful Jewess with a pearly skin and a head positively foaming with curls, a tall Scandinavian, an obvious German, several more Americans. Not one of them made the photograph on her mind equal to those made by the coloured girl whose name, she learned, was Rachel Powell, the slate-eyed Martha Burden, Paulette Lister and Anthony Cross. Her prediction came true. With in a week she was on jestingly intimate terms with every one of them except Miss Powell, who lent her belongings, borrowed nothing, and spoke only when she was spoken to. At the end of ten days          Miss Burden asked Angela to come and have lunch " at the same place where I go ".    On an exquisite afternoon she went to Harlem. At One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street she left the 'bus and walked through from Seventh Avenue to Lenox, then up to One Hundred and Forty- seventh Street and back down Seventh Avenue to One Hundred and Thirty-ninth Street, through this to Eighth Avenue and then weaving back and forth between the two Avenues through Thirty- eighth, Thirty-seventh down to One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street to Eighth Avenue where she took the Elevated and went back to the New York which she knew.  But she was amazed and impressed at this bust ling, frolicking, busy, laughing great city within a greater one. She had never seen coloured life so thick, so varied, so complete. Moreover, just as this city reproduced in microcosm all the important features of any metropolis, so undoubtedly life up here was just the same, she thought dimly, as life anywhere else. Not all these people, she realized, glancing keenly at the throngs of black and brown, yellow and white faces about her were servants or underlings or end men. She saw a beautiful woman all brown and red dressed as exquisitely as anyone she had seen on Fifth Avenue. A man's sharp, high-bred face etched itself on her memory, the face of a professional man perhaps, it might be an artist. She doubted that; he might of course be a musician, but it was unlikely that he would be her kind of an artist, for how could he        exist? Ah, there lay the great difference. In all material, even in all practical things these two worlds were alike, but in the production, the foster ing of those ultimate manifestations, this world was lacking, for its people were without the means or the leisure to support them and enjoy. And these were the manifestations which she craved, together with the freedom to enjoy them. No, she was not sorry that she had chosen as she had, even though she could now realize that life viewed from the angle of Opal and Jefferson Streets in Phila delphia and that same life viewed from One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street and Seventh Avenue in New York might present bewilderingly different facets.  Unquestionably there was something very fascin ating, even terrible, about this stream of life, it seemed to her to run thicker, more turgidly than that safe, sublimated existence in which her new friends had their being. It was deeper, more mightily moving even than the torrent of Four teenth Street. Undoubtedly just as these people, for she already saw them objectively, doubly so, once with her natural remoteness and once with the remoteness of her new estate, just as these people could suffer more than others, just so they could enjoy themselves more. She watched the moiling groups on Lenox Avenue; the amazingly well-dressed and good-looking throngs of young men on Seventh Avenue at One Hundred and Thirty-seventh and Thirty-fifth Streets. They were gossiping, laughing, dickering, chaffing, com bining the customs of the small town with the astonishing cosmopolitanism of their clothes and manners. Nowhere down town did she see life  G      like this. Oh, all this was fuller, richer, not finer but richer with the difference in quality that there is between velvet and silk. Harlem was a great city, but after all it was a city within a city, and she was glad, as she strained for last glimpses out of the lurching " L " train, that she had cast in her lot with the dwellers outside its dark and serried tents.      " WHERE do you live? " asked Paulette, " when you're not here at school? "  Angela blushed as she told her.  " In a hotel? In Union Square? Child, are you a millionaire? Where did you come from? Don't you care anything about the delights of home? Mr. Cross, come closer. Here is this poor child living benightedly in a hotel when she might have two rooms at least in the Village for almost the same price."  Mr. Cross came closer but without saying any thing. He was really, Angela thought, a very serious, almost sad young man. He had never continued long the bantering line with which he had first made her acquaintance.  She explained that she had not known where to go. " Often I've thought of moving, and of course I'm spending too much money for what I get out of it, I've the littlest room."  Paulette opened her eyes very wide which gave an onlooker the e fleet of seeing suddenly the blue sky very close at hand. Her cheeks took on a flaming tint. She was really a beautiful, even fascinating girl or woman, Angela never learned which, for she never knew her age. But her fascina tion did not rest on her looks, or at least it did not arise from that source; it was more the result of      her manner. She was so alive, so intense, so inter ested, if she were interested, that all her nerves, her emotions even were enlisted to accomplish the end which she might have in view. And withal she possessed the simplicity of a child. There was an unsuspected strength about her also that was oddly at variance with the rather striking fragility of her appearance, the trustingness of her gaze, the limpid unaflectedness of her manner. Mr. Gross, Angela thought negligently, must be in love with her; he was usually at her side when they sketched. But later she came to see that there was nothing at all between these two except a certain friendly appreciation tempered by a wary kind ness on the part of Mr. Gross and a negligent generosity on the part of Paulette.  She displayed no negligence of generosity in her desire and eagerness to find Angela a suitable apartment. She did hold out, however, with amazing frankness for one " not too near me but also not too far away ". But this pleased the girl, for she had been afraid that Paulette would insist on offering to share her own apart ment and she would not have known how to refuse. She had the complete egoist's desire for solitude.  Paulette lived on Bank Street; she found for her new friend " a duck, just a duck, no other word will describe it, of an apartment " on Jayne Street, two rooms, bath and kitchenette. There was also a tiny balcony giving on a mews. It was more than Angela should have afforded, but the ease with which her affairs were working out gave her an assurance, almost an arrogance of confidence. Besides she planned      to save by getting her own meals. The place was already furnished, its former occupant was preparing to go to London for two or more years.  " Two years," Angela said gaily, " everything in the world can happen to me in that time. Oh I wonder what will have happened; what I will be like ! " And she prepared to move in her slender store of possessions. Anthony, prompted, she suspected by Paulette, offered rather shyly to help her. It was a rainy day, there were several boxes after all, and taxis were scarce, though finally he captured one for her and came riding back in triumph with the driver. After wards a few books had to be arranged, pictures must be hung. She had an inspiration.  " You tend to all this and I'll get you the best dinner you ever tasted in your life." Memories of Monday night dinners on Opal Street flooded her memory. She served homely, filling dishes, " fit for a drayman," she teased him. There were corn-beef hash, roasted sweet potatoes, corn pudding, and, regardless of the hour, muffins. After supper she refused to let him help her with the dishes but had him rest in the big chair in the living-room while she laughed and talked with him from the kitchenette at a distance of two yards. Gradually, as he sat there smoking, the sadness and strain faded out of his thin, dark face, he laughed and jested like any other normal young man. When he bade her good-bye he let his slow dark gaze rest in hers for a long silent moment. She closed the door and stood laughing, arranging her hair before the mirror.          " Of course he's loads better looking, but some thing about him makes me think of Matthew Henson. But nothing doing, young-fellow-me-lad. Spanish and I suppose terribly proud. I wonder what he'd say if he really knew? "    She was to go to Paulette's to dinner. "Just we two," stipulated Miss Lister. " Of course, I could have a gang of men, but I think it will be fun for us to get acquainted." Angela was pleased; she was very fond of Paulette, she liked her for her generous, capable self. And she was not quite ready for meeting men. She must know something more about these people with whom she was spending her life. Anthony Cross had been affable enough, but she was not sure that he, with his curious sadness, his half-proud, half-sensitive tendency to withdrawal, were a fair enough type. However, in spite of Paulette's protestations, there were three young men standing in her large, dark living-room when Angela arrived.  " But you've got to go at once," said Paulette, laughing but firm; " here is my friend, isn't she beautiful? We've too many things to discuss without being bothered by you."  " Paulette has these fits of cruelty," said one of the three, a short, stocky fellow with an ugly, sensitive face. " She'd have made a good Nero. But anyway I'm glad I stayed long enough to see you. Don't let her hide you from us altogether." Another man made a civil remark; the third one standing back in the gloomy room said nothing, but the girl caught the impression of tallness          and blondness and of a pair of blue eyes which stared at her intently. She felt awkward and showed it.  " See, you've made her shy," said Paulette accusingly. " I won't bother introducing them, Angele, you'll meet them all too soon." Laugh ing, protesting, the men filed out, and their un willing hostess closed the door on them with sincere lack of regret. " Men," she mused can didly. " Of course we can't get along without them any more than they can without us, but I get tired of them, they're nearly all animals. I'd rather have a good woman friend any day." She sighed with genuine sincerity. " Yet my place is always full of men. Would you rather have your chops rare or well done? I like mine cooked to a cinder." Angela preferred hers well done. " Stay here and look around; see if I have anything to amuse you." Catching up an apron she vanished into some smaller and darker retreat which she called her kitchen.  The apartment consisted of the whole floor of a house on Bank Street, dark and constantly within the sound of the opening front door and the noises of the street. " But you don't have the damned stairs when you come in late at night," Paulette explained. The front room was, Angela supposed, the bedroom, though the only reason for this supposition was the appearance of a dressing-table and a wide, flat divan about one foot and a half from the floor, covered with black or purple velvet. The dressing table was a good piece of mahogany, but the chairs were indifferently of the kitchen variety and of the sort which, magazines affirm, may be made out of          a large packing box. In the living room, where the little table was set, the same anomaly pre vailed; the china was fine, even dainty, but the glasses were thick and the plating had begun to wear off the silver ware. On the other hand the pictures were unusual, none of the stereotyped things; instead Angela remarked a good copy of Breughel's " Peasant Wedding ", the head of Bernini and two etchings whose authors she did not know. The bookcase held two paper bound volumes of the poems of Beranger and Villon and a little black worn copy of Heine. But the other books were high-brow to the point of austerity: Ely, Shaw and Strindberg.  " Perhaps you'd like to wash your hands? " called Paulette. " There's a bathroom down the corridor there, you can't miss it. You may have some of my favourite lotion if you want it up there on the shelf." Angela washed her hands and looked up for the lotion. Her eyes opened wide in amazement. Beside the bottle stood a man's shaving mug and brush and a case of razors.  The meal, " for you can't call it a dinner," the cook remarked candidly, was a success. The chops were tender though smoky; there were spinach, potatoes, tomato and lettuce salad, rolls, coffee and cheese. Its rugged quality surprised Angela not a little; it was more a meal for a work ing man than for a woman, above all, a woman of the faery quality of Paulette. " I get so tired," she said, lifting a huge mouthful, " if I don't eat heartily; besides it ruins my temper to go hungry." Her whole attitude toward the meal was so masculine and her appearance so daintily      feminine that Angela burst out laughing, ex plaining with much amusement the cause of her merriment. " I hope you don't mind," she ended, " for of course you are conspicuously feminine. There's nothing of the man about you."  To her surprise Paulette resented this last statement. " There is a great deal of the man about me. I've learned that a woman is a fool who lets her femininity stand in the way of what she wants. I've made a philosophy of it. I see what I want; I use my wiles as a woman to get it, and I employ the qualities of men, tenacity and ruthlessness, to keep it. And when I'm through with it, I throw it away just as they do. Consequently I have no regrets and no encumbrances."  A packet of cigarettes lay open on the table and she motioned to her friend to have one. Angela refused, and sat watching her inhale in deep respirations; she had never seen a woman more completely at ease, more assuredly mistress of herself and of her fate. When they had begun eating Paulette had poured out two cocktails, tossing hers off immediately and finishing Angela's, too, when the latter, finding it too much like machine oil for her taste, had set it down scarcely diminished. " You'll get used to them if you go about with these men. You'll be drinking along with the rest of us."  She had practically no curiosity and on the other hand no reticences. And she had met with every conceivable experience, had visited France, Ger many and Sweden; she was now contemplating a trip to Italy and might go to Russia; she would      go now, in fact, if it were not that a friend of hers, Jack Hudson, was about to go there, too, and as she was on the verge of having an affair with him she thought she'd better wait. She didn't relish the prospect of such an event in a foreign land, it put you too much at the man's mercy. An affair, if you were going to have one, was much better conducted on your own pied a terre.  " An affair? " gasped Angela.  " Yes, why, haven't you ever had a lover? "  " A lover? "  " Goodness me, are you a poll parrot? Why yes, a lover. I've had " she hesitated before the other's complete amazement, " I've had more than one, I can tell you."  " And you've no intention of marrying? "  " Oh I don't say that; but what's the use of tying yourself up now while you're young? And then, too, this way you don't always have them around your feet; you can always leave them or they'll leave you. But it's better for you to leave them first. It insures your pride." With her babyish face and her sweet, high voice she was like a child babbling precociously. Yet she seemed bathed in intensity. But later she began to talk of her books and of her pictures, of her work and on all these subjects she spoke with the same sub dued excitement; her eye\ flashed, her cheeks grew scarlet, all experience meant life to her in various manifestations. She had been on a news paper, one of the New York dailies; she had done press-agenting. At present she was illustrating for a fashion magazine. There was no end to her versatilities.        Angela said she must go.  " But you'll come again soon, won't you, Angele? "  A wistfulness crept into her voice. "I do so want a woman friend. When a woman really is your friend she's so dependable and she's not expecting anything in return." She saw her guest to the door. " We could have some wonderful times. Good-night, Angele." Like a child she lifted her face to be kissed.  Angela's first thought as she walked down the dark street was for the unfamiliar name by which Paulette had called her. For though she had signed herself very often as Angele, no one as yet used it. Her old familiar formula came to her: " I wonder what she would think if she knew." But of one thing she was sure : if Paulette had been in her place she would have acted in exactly the same way. " She would have seen what she wanted and would have taken it," she murmured and fell to thinking of the various confidences which Paulette had bestowed upon her, though so frank and unreserved were her remarks that " confidences " was hardly the name to apply to them. Certainly, Angela thought, she was in a new world and with new people. Beyond question some of the coloured people of her acquaintance must have lived in a manner which would not bear inspection, but she could not think of one who would thus have discussed it calmly with either friend or stranger. Wondering what it would be like to conduct oneself absolutely accord ing to one's own laws, she turned into the dark little vestibule on Jayne Street. As usual the Jewish girl who lived above her was standing blurred in the      thick blackness of the hall, and as usual Angela did not realize this until, touching the button and turning on the light, she caught sight of Miss Salting straining her face upwards to receive her lover's kiss.          FROM the pinnacle of her satisfaction in her studies, in her new friends and in the joke which she was having upon custom and tradition she looked across the class-room at Miss Powell who pre served her attitude of dignified reserve. Angela thought she would try to break it down; on Wed nesday she asked the coloured girl to have lunch with her and was pleased to have the invitation accepted. She had no intention of taking the girl up as a matter either of patronage or of loyalty. But she thought it would be nice to offer her the ordinary amenities which their common student life made natural and possible. Miss Powell it appeared ate generally in an Automat or in a cafeteria, but Angela knew of a nice tea-room. "It's rather arty, but they do serve a good meal and it's cheap." Unfortunately on Wednesday she had to leave before noon; she told Miss Powell to meet her at the little restaurant. " Go in and get a table and wait for me, but I'm sure I'll be there as soon as you will." After all she was late, but, what was worse, she found to her dismay that Miss Powell, instead of entering the tea-room, had been awaiting her across the street. There were no tables and the two had to wait almost fifteen minutes before being served,    !'}'$-}    "Why cm earth didn't you go in?" asked Angela a trifle impatiently, "you could have held the table." Miss Powell answered imper- turbably: "Because I didn't know how they would receive me if I went in by myself." Angela could not pretend to misunderstand her. " Oh, I think they would have been all right," she murmured, blushing at her stupidity. How quickly she had forgotten those fears and uncer tainties. She had never experienced this sort of difficulty herselfj but she certainly knew of them from Virginia and others.  The lunch was not a particularly pleasant one. Either Miss Powell was actually dull or she had made a resolve never to let herself go in the presence of white people; perhaps she feared being misunderstood, perhaps she saw in such encounters a lurking attempt at sociological in vestigations; she would lend herself to no such procedure, that much was plain. Angela could feel her effort to charm, to invite confidence, glance upon and fall back from this impenetrable armour. She had been amazed to find both Paulette and Martha Burden already gaining their living by their sketches. Miss Burden indeed was a caricaturist of no mean local reputation; Anthony Cross was frankly a commercial artist, though he hoped some day to be a recognised painter of portraits. She was curious to learn of Miss Powell's pros pects. Inquiry revealed that the young lady had one secret aspiration; to win or earn enough money to go to France and then after that, she said with sudden ardour, " anything could happen ". To this end she had worked, saved, scraped, gone without pleasures and clothes. Her  no    >  work was creditable, indeed above the average, but not sufficiently imbued, Angela thought, with the divine promise to warrant this sublimation of normal desires.  Miss Powell seemed to read her thought. " And then it gives me a chance to show America that one of us can stick ; that we have some idea above the ordinary humdrum of existence."  She made no attempt to return the luncheon but she sent Angela one day a jonquils, and made no further attempt at friend ship. To one versed in the psychology of this proud, sensitive people the reason was perfectly plain. " You've been awfully nice to me and I appreciate it but don't think Pm going to thrust myself upon you. Your ways and mine lie along different paths."    Such contacts, such interpretations and inves tigations were making up her life, a life that for her was interesting and absorbing, but which had its perils and uncertainties. She had no purpose, for it was absurd for her, even with her ability, to consider Art an end. She was using it now deliber ately, as she had always used it vaguely, to get in touch with interesting people and with a more attractive atmosphere. And she was spending money too fast; she had been in New York eight months, and she had already spent a thousand dollars. At this rate her little fortune which had seemed at first inexhaustible would last her less than two years; at best, eighteen months more. Then she must face, what? Teaching again?  in        Never, she'd had enough of that. Perhaps she could earn her living with her brush, doing menu cards, Christmas and birthday greetings, flowers, Pierrots and Pierrettes on satin pillow tops. She did not relish that. True there were the specialities of Paulette and of Martha Burden, but she lacked the deft sureness of the one and the slightly mordant philosophy underlying the work of the other. Her own speciality she felt sure lay along the line of reproducing, of interpreting on a face the emotion which lay back of that expression. She thought of her Fourteenth Street " types ", that would be the sort of work which she would really enjoy, that and the depicting of the countenance of a purse-proud but lonely man, of the silken inanity of a society girl, of the smiling despair of a harlot. Even in her own mind she hesi tated before the use of that terrible word, but association was teaching her to call a spade a spade.  Yes, she might do worse than follow the example of Mr. Cross and become a portrait painter. But somehow she did not want to have to do this; necessity would, she was sure, spoil her touch; besides, she hated the idea of the position in which she would be placed, fearfully placating and flatter ing possible patrons, hurrying through with an order because she needed the cheque, accepting patronage and condescension. No, she hoped to be sought after, to have the circumstances which would permit her to pick and choose, to refuse if the whim pleased her. It should mean something to be painted by " Mory ". People would say, "I'm going to have my portrait done by ' Mory ' ". But all this would call for position, power, wealth,        And again she said to herself . . . " I might marry a white man. Marriage is the easiest way for a woman to get those things, and white men have them." But she knew only one white man, Anthony Gross, and he would never have those qualities, at least not by his deliberate seeking. They might come eventually but only after long years. Long, long years of struggle with realities. There was a simple, genuine stead fastness in him that made her realize that he would seek for the expression of truth and of himself even at the cost of the trimmings of life. And she was ashamed, for she knew that for the vanities and gewgaws of a leisurely and irresponsible existence she would sacrifice her own talent, the integrity of her ability to interpret life, to write down a history with her brush.    Martha Burden was as strong and as pronounced a personage as Paulette; even stronger perhaps because she had the great gift of silence. Paulette, as Angela soon realized, lived in a state of con stant defiance. " I don't care what people think," was her slogan; men and women appealed to her in proportion to the opposition which they, too, proclaimed for the established thing. Angela was surprised that she clung as persistently as she did to a friendship with a person as conventional and reactionary as herself. But Martha Burden was not like that. One could not tell whether or not she was thinking about other people's opinions. It was probable that the other people and their attitude never entered her mind. She was cool  H    and slightly aloof, with the coolness and aloofness of her slaty eyes and her thick, tawny hair. Neither the slatiness nor the tawniness proclaimed warmth only depth, depth and again depth. It was impossible to realize what she would be like if im passioned or deeply stirred to anger. There would probably be something implacable, god-like about her; she would be capable of a long, slow, steady burning of passion. Few men would love Martha though many might admire her. But a man once enchanted might easily die for her.  Angela liked her house with its simple elegance, its fine, soft curtains and steady, shaded glow of light that stood somehow for home. She liked her husband, Ladislas Starr, whom Martha produced without a shade of consciousness that this was the first intimation she had given of being married. They were strong individualists, molten and blended in a design which failed to obscure their emphatic personalities. Their apartment in the Village was large and neat and sunny; it bore no trace of palpable wealth, yet nothing conducing to comfort was lacking. Book-cases in the dining- room and living-room spilled over; the Nation, the Mercury, the Crisis, a magazine of the darker races, left on the broad arm of an easy chair, mutely invited; it was late autumn, almost winter, but there were jars of fresh flowers. The bedroom where Angela went to remove her wrap was dainty and restful.  The little gathering to which Martha had in vited her was made up of members as strongly individual as the host and hostess. They were all specialists in their way, and specialists for the most part in some offshoot of a calling or movement      which was itself already highly specialized. Martha presented a psychiatrist, a war correspondent, " I'm that only when there is a war of course," he explained to Angela's openly respectful gaze, a dramatist, a corporation lawyer, a white-faced, conspicuously beautiful poet with a long evasive Russian name, two press agents, a theatrical manager, an actress who played only Shakespeare roles, a teacher of defective children and a medical student who had been a conscientious objector and had served a long time at Leavenworth. He lapsed constantly into a rapt self-communing from whch he only roused himself to utter fiery tirades against the evils of society.  In spite of their highly specialised interests they were all possessed of a common ground of knowledge in which such subjects as Russia, Consumers' Leagues, and the coming presidential election figured most largely. There was much laughter and chaffing but no airiness, no per siflage. One of the press agents, Mrs. Cecil, entered upon a long discussion with the corpora tion lawyer on a Bill pending before Congress; she knew as much as he about the matter and held her own in a long and almost bitter argu ment which only the coming of refreshments broke up.  Just before the close of the argument two other young men had come in, but Angela never learned their vocation. Furthermore she was interested in observing the young teacher of defective children. She was coloured; small and well-built, exquisitely dressed, and of a beautiful tint, all bronze and soft red, " like Jinny " thought Angela, a little aston ished to observe how the warmth of her appearance        overshadowed or rather overshone everyone else in the room. The tawniness even of Miss Burden's hair went dead beside her. The only thing to cope with her richness was the classical beauty of the Russian poet's features. He seemed unable to keep his eyes away from her; was punctiliously attentive to her wants and leaned forward several times during the long political discussion to whisper low spoken and apparently amusing comments. The young woman, perfectly at ease in her deep chair, received his attentions with a slightly detached, amused objectivity; an objectivity which she had for everyone in the room including Angela at whom she had glanced once rather sharply. But the detachment of her manner was totally different from Miss Powell's sensitive dignity. Totally without self-consciousness she let her warm dark eyes travel from one face to another. She might have been saying: " How far you are away from the things that really matter, birth and death and hard, hard work ! " The Russian poet must have realized this, for once Angela heard him say, leaning forward, " Tou think all this is futile, don't you? "    Martha motioned for her to wait a moment until most of the other guests had gone, then she came forward with one of the two young men who had come in without introduction. " This is Roger Fielding, he'll see you home."  He was tall and blond with deeply blue eyes which smiled on her as he said: " Would you like to walk or ride? It's raining a little."  Angela said she preferred to walk.     " All right then. Here, Starr, come across with that umbrella I lent you."  They went out into the thin, tingling rain of late Autumn. " I was surprised," said Roger, " to see you there with the high-brows. I didn't think you looked that way when I met you at Paulette's."  " We've met before? I'm I'm sorry, but I don't seem to remember you."  " No I don't suppose you would. Well, we didn't exactly meet; I saw you one day at Paul ette's. That's why I came this evening, because I heard you'd be here and I'd get a chance to see you again; but I was surprised because you didn't seem like that mouthy make me tired taking life so plaguey seriously. Martha and her old high-brows ! " he ended ungratefully.  Angela, a little taken back with the frankness of his desire to meet her, said she hadn't thought they were serious.  "Not think them serious? Great Scott! what kind of talk are you used to? You look as though you'd just come out of a Sunday-school ! Do you prefer bible texts? "  But she could not explain to him the picture which she saw in her mind of men and women at her father's home in Opal Street, the men talking painfully of rents, of lynchings, of building and loan associations; the women of child-bearing and the sacrifices which must be made to put Gertie through school, to educate Howard. " I don't mean for any of my children to go through what I did." And in later years in her own first maturity, young Henson and Sawyer and the          others in the tiny parlour talking of ideals and in evitable sacrifices for the race; the burnt-offering of individualism for some dimly glimpsed racial whole. This was seriousness, even sombreness, with a great sickening vital upthrust of reality. But these other topics, peaks of civilization superimposed upon peaks, she found, even though interesting, utterly futile.  They had reached the little hall now. " We must talk loud," she whispered.  " Why? " he asked, speaking obediently very loud indeed.  " Wait a minute; no, she's not there. The girl above me meets her young man here at night and just as sure as I forget her and come in quietly there they are in the midst of a kiss. I suspect she hates me."  In his young male sophistication he thought at first that this was a lead, but her air was so gay and so childishly guileless that he changed his opinion. " Though no girl in this day and time could be as simple and innocent as she looks."  But aloud he said, " Of course she doesn't hate you, nobody could do that. I assure you I don't."  She thought his gallantries very amusing. " Well, it relieves me to hear you say so; that'll keep me from worrying for one night at least." And withdrawing her hand from his retaining grasp, she ran upstairs.    A letter from Virginia lay inside the door, Getting ready for bed she read it in bits.        " Angela darling, wouldn't it be fun if I were to come to New York too? Of course you'd keep on living in your Village and I'd live in famous Harlem, but we'd both be in the same city, which is where two only sisters ought to be, dumb I calls it to live apart the way we do. The man out at the U. of P. is crazy to have me take an exam, in music; it would be easy enough and much better pay than I get here. So there are two perfectly good reasons why I should come. He thinks I'll do him credit and I want to get away from this town."  Then between the lines the real reason betrayed itself :  " I do have such awful luck. Edna Brown had a party out in Merion not long ago and Matthew took me. And you know what riding in a train can do for me, well that night of all nights I had to become car-sick. Matthew had been so nice. He came to see me the next morning, but, child, he's never been near me from that day to this. I suppose a man can't get over a girl's being such a sight as I was that night. Can't things be too hateful ! "  Angela couldn't help murmuring: " Imagine anyone wanting old Matthew so badly that she's willing to break up her home to get over him. Now why couldn't he have liked her instead of me?"  And pondering on such mysteries she crept into bed. But she fell to thinking again about the evening she had spent with Martha and the people whom she had met. And again it seemed to her that they represented an almost alarmingly un necessary class. If any great social cataclysm were    to happen they would surely be the first to be swept out of the running. Only the real people could survive. Even Paulette's mode of living, it seemed to her, had something more forthright and vital.          IN the morning she was awakened by the ringing of the telephone. The instrument was an extrava gance, for, save for Anthony's, she received few calls and made practically none. But the woman from whom she had taken the apartment had per suaded her into keeping it. Still, as she had never indicted the change in ownership, its value was small. She lay there for a moment blinking drowsily in the thin but intensely gold sunshine of December thinking that her ears were deceiving her.  Finally she reached out a rosy arm, curled it about the edge of the door jamb and, reaching the little table that stood in the other room just on the other side of the door, set the instrument up in her bed. The apartment was so small that almost everything was within arm's reach.  " Hello," she murmured sleepily.  " Oh, I thought you must be there; I said to myself: ' She couldn't have left home this early '. What time do you go to that famous drawing class of yours anyway? J>  " I beg your pardon ! Who is this speaking, please? "  " Why, Roger, of course, Roger Fielding. Don't say you've forgotten me already. This is Angele, isn't it? "          " Yes this is Angele Mory speaking, Mr. Field ing."  " Did I o fiend your Highness, Miss Mory? Will you have lunch with me to-day and let me tell you how sorry I am? "  But she was lunching with Anthony. " I have an engagement."  " Of course you have. Well, will you have tea, dinner, supper to-day, breakfast and all the other meals to-morrow and so on for a week? You might just as well say ' yes ' because I'll pester you till you do."  "I'm engaged for tea, too, but I'm not really as popular as I sound. That's my last engagement for this week; I'll be glad to have dinner with you."  " Right-oh ! Now don't go back and finish up that beauty sleep, for if you're any more charm ing than you were last night I won't answer for myself. I'll be there at eight."  Inexperienced as she was, she was still able to recognize his method as a bit florid; she preferred, on the whole, Anthony's manner at lunch when he leaned forward and touching her hand very lightly said: "Isn't it great for us to be here! I'm so content, Angele. Promise me you'll have lunch with me every day this week. I've had a streak of luck with my drawings."  She promised him, a little thrilled herself with his evident sincerity and with the niceness of the smile which so transfigured his dark, thin face, robbing it of its tenseness and strain.  Still something, some vanity, some vague pre monition of adventure, led her to linger over her          dressing for the dinner with Roger. There was never very much colour in her cheeks, but her skin was warm and white; there was vitality beneath her pallor; her hair was warm, too, long and thick and yet so fine that it gave her little head the e fleet of being surrounded by a nimbus of light; rather wayward, glancing, shifting light for there were little tendrils and wisps and curls in front and about the temples which no amount of coaxing could subdue. She touched up her mouth a little, not so much to redden it as to give a hint of the mondaine to her appearance. Her dress was flame-colour Paulette had induced her to buy it, of a plain, rather heavy beautiful glowing silk. The neck was high in back and girlishly modest in front. She had a string of good arti ficial pearls and two heavy silver bracelets. Thus she gave the e fleet of a flame herself; intense and opaque at the heart where her dress gleamed and shone, transparent and fragile where her white warm neck and face rose into the tenuous shadow of her hair. Her appearance excited herself.  Roger found her delightful. As to women he considered himself a connoisseur. This girl pleased him in many respects. She was young; she was, when lighted from within by some indescribable mechanism, even beautiful; she had charm and, what was for him even more important, she was puzzling. In repose, he noticed, studying her closely, her quiet look took on the resemblance of an arrested movement, a composure on tip-toe so to speak, as though she had been stopped in the swift transition from one mood to another. And back of that momentary cessation of action          one could see a mind darting, quick, restless, indefatigable, observing, tabulating perhaps even mocking. She had for him the quality of the foreigner, but she gave this quality an objectivity as though he were the stranger and she the well- known established personage taking note of his peculiarities and apparently boundlessly diverted by them.  But of all this Angela was absolutely unaware. No wonder she was puzzling to Roger, for, in addition to the excitement which she a young woman in the high tide of her youth, her health, and her beauty would be feeling at receiving in the proper setting the devotion and attention which all women crave, she was swimming in the flood of excitement created by her unique position. Stolen waters are the sweetest. And Angela never forgot that they were stolen. She thought: " Here I am having everything that a girl ought to have just because I had sense enough to suit my actions to my appearance." The realization, the secret fun bubbling back in some hidden recess of her heart, brought colour to her cheeks, a certain temerity to her manner. Roger pondered on this quality. If she were reckless !  The dinner was perfect; it was served with elegance and beauty. Indeed she was surprised at the surroundings, the grandeur even of the hotel to which he had brought her. She had no idea of his means, but had supposed that his circumstances were about those of her other new friends; probably he was better off than Anthony, whose poverty she instinctively sensed, and she judged that his income, whatever it might be,          was not so perilous as Paulette's. But she would have put him on the same footing as the Starrs. This sort of expenditure, however, meant money, " unless he really does like me and is splurging this time just for me ". The idea appealed to her vanity and gave her a sense of power; she looked at Roger with a warm smile. At once his intent, considering gaze filmed; he was already leaning toward her but he bent even farther across the perfect little table and asked in a low, eager tone: " Shall we stay here and dance or go to your house and talk and smoke a bit? "  " Oh we'll stay and dance; it would be so late by the time we get home that we'd only have a few minutes."  Presently the golden evening was over and they were in the vestibule at Jayne Street. Roger said very loudly: " Where's that push button? " Then lower: " Well, your young lovers aren't here to-night either. I'm beginning to think you made that story up, Angele."  She assured him, laughing, that she had told the truth. " You come here some time and you'll see them for yourself." But she wished she could think of something more ordinary to say. His hands held hers very tightly; they were very strong and for the first time she noticed that the veins stood up on them like cords. She tried to pull her own away and he released them and, taking her key, turned the lock in the inner door, then stood looking down at her.  " Well I'm glad they're not here to-night to take their revenge." And as he handed her back the key he kissed her on the lips. His knowledge      of women based on many, many such experiences, told him that her swift retreat was absolutely unfeigned.  As on a former occasion she stood, after she had gained her room, considering herself in the glass. She had been kissed only once before, by Matthew Henson, and that kiss had been neither as casual nor as disturbing as this. She was thrilled, excited, and vaguely displeased. " He is fresh, I'll say that for him." And subsiding into the easy chair she thought for a long time of Anthony Cross and his deep respectful ardour.  In the morning there were flowers.    From the class-room she went with Paulette to deliver the latter's sketches. " Have tea to-day with me; we'll blow ourselves at the Ritz. This is the only time in the month that I have any money, so we'll make the best of it."  Angela looked about the warm, luxurious room at the serene, luxurious women, the super-groomed, super-deferential, tremendously confident men. She sighed. " I love all this, love it."  Paulette, busy blowing smoke-rings, nodded. " I blew sixteen that time. Watch me do it again. There's nothing really to this kind of life, you know."  " Oh don't blow smoke-rings ! It's the only thing in the world that can spoil your looks. What do you mean there's nothing to it?"      " Well for a day-in-and-day-out existence, it just doesn't do. It's too boring. It's fun for you and me to drift in here twice a year when we've just had a nice, fat cheque which we've got to spend. But there's nothing to it for every day; it's too much like reaching the harbour where you would be. The tumult and the shout ing are all over. I'd rather live just above the danger line down on little old Bank Street, and think up a way to make five hundred dollars so I could go to the French Riviera second class and bum around those little towns, Villefranche, Beaulieu, Cagnes, you must see them, Angele and have a spanking affair with a real man with honest to God blood in his veins than to sit here and drink tea and listen to the nothings of all these tame tigers, trying you out, seeing how much it will take to buy you."  Angela was bewildered by this outburst. " I thought you said you didn't like affairs unless you could conduct them on your own pied d terre."  " Did I? Well that was another time not to-day. By the way, what would you say if I were to tell you that I'm going to Russia? "  She glanced at her friend with the bright shame- lessness of a child, for she knew that Angela had heard of Jack Hudson's acceptance as newspaper correspondent in Moscow.  " I wouldn't say anything except that I'd much rather be here in the warmth and cleanliness of the Ritz than be in Moscow where I'm sure it will be cold and dirty."  c That's because you've never wanted anyone." Her face for a moment was all desire. Beautiful      but terrible too. " She actually looks like Hetty Daniels," thought Angela in astonishment. Only, alas, there was no longer any beauty in Hetty's face.  " When you've set your heart on anybody or on anything there'll be no telling what you'll do, Angele. For all your innocence you're as deep, you'll be as desperate as Martha Burden once you're started. I know your kind. Well, if you must play around in the Ritz, etcet., etcet., I'll tell Roger Fielding. He's a good squire and he can afford it."  " Why? Is he so rich? "  " Rich ! If all the wealth that he no, not he, but his father if all the wealth that old man Field ing possesses were to be converted into silver dollars there wouldn't be space enough in this room, big as it is, to hold it."  Angela tried to envisage it. " And Roger, what does he do? "  " Spend it. What is there for him to do? Nothing except have a good time and keep in his father's good graces. His father's some kind of a personage and all that, you know, crazy about his name and his posterity. Roger doesn't dare get drunk and lie in the gutter and he mustn't make a misalliance. Outside of that the world's his oyster and he eats it every day. There's a boy who gets everything he wants."  " What do you mean by a misalliance? He's not royalty."  " Spoken like a good American. No, he's not. But he mustn't marry outside certain limits. No chorus girl romances for his father. The old man        wouldn't care a rap about money but he would insist on blue blood and the Mayflower. The funny thing is that Roger, for all his appearing so democratic, is that way too. But of course he's been so run after the marvel is that he's as unspoiled as he is. But it's the one thing I can't stick in him. I don't mind a man's not marrying me; but I can't forgive him if he thinks I'm not good enough to marry him. Any woman is better than the best of men." Her face took on its intense, burning expression; one would have said she was consumed with excitement.  Angela nodded, only half-listening. Roger a multi-millionaire ! Roger who only two nights ago had kissed and mumbled her fingers, his eyes avid and yet so humble and beseeching!  " One thing, if you do start playing around with Roger be careful. He's a good bit of a rotter, and he doesn't care what he says or spends to gain his ends." She laughed at the inquiry in her friend's eyes. " No, I've never given Roger five minutes' thought. But I know his kind. They're dangerous. It's wrong for men to have both money and power; they're bound to make some woman suffer. Come on up the Avenue with me and I'll buy a hat. I can't wear this whang any longer. It's too small, looks like a peanut on a barrel."    Angela was visual minded. She saw the days of the week, the months of the year in little narrow divisions of space. She saw the past years of her        life falling into separate, uneven compartments whose ensemble made up her existence. Whenever she looked back on this period from Christmas to Easter she saw a bluish haze beginning in a white mist and flaming into something red and terrible; and across the bluish haze stretched the name: Roger.  Roger! She had never seen anyone like him: so gay, so beautiful, like a blond, glorious god, so overwhelming, so persistent. She had not liked him so much at first except as one likes the sun or the sky or a singing bird, anything jolly and free. There had been no touching points for their minds. He knew nothing of life except what was pleasurable; it is true his idea of the pleasurable did not always coincide with hers. He had no fears, no restraints, no worries. Yes, he had one; he did not want to offend his father. He wanted ardently and unswervingly his father's money, he did not begrudge his senior a day, an hour, a moment of life; about this he had a queer, unselfish sincerity. The old financial war horse had made his fortune by hard labour and pitiless fighting. He had given Roger his being, the entree into a wonderful existence. Already he bestowed upon him an annual sum which would have kept several families in comfort. If Roger had cared to save for two years he need never have asked his father for another cent. With any kind of luck he could have built up for himself a second colossal fortune. But he did not care to do this. He did not wish his father one instant's loss of life or of its enjoyment. But he did want final possession of those millions.  Angela liked him best when he talked about     " my dad " ; he never mentioned the vastness of his wealth, but by now she could not have helped guessing even without Paulette's aid that he was a wealthy man. She would not take jewellery from him, but there was a steady stream of flowers, fruit, candy, books, fine copies of the old masters. She was afraid and ashamed to express a longing in his presence. And with all this his steady, constant attendance. And an odd watchfulness which she felt but could not explain.  " He must love me," she said to herself, think ing of his caresses. She had been unable to keep him from kissing her. Her uneasiness had amused and charmed him: he laughed at her Puritanism, succeeded in shaming her out of it. " Child, where have you lived? Why there's nothing in a kiss. If I didn't kiss you I couldn't come to see you. And I have to see you, Angele ! " His voice grew deep; the expression in his eyes made her own falter.  Yet he did not ask her to marry him. " But I suppose it's because he can see I don't love him yet." And she wondered what it would be like to love. Even Jinny knew more about this than she, for she had felt, perhaps still did feel, a strong affection for Matthew Henson. Well, anyway, if they married she would pro bably come to love him; most women learned to love their husbands. At first after her con versation with Paulette about Roger she had rather expected a diminution at any time of his attentions, for after all she was unknown ; from Roger's angle she would be more than outside the pale. But she was sure now that he loved and      would want to marry her, for it never occurred to her that men bestowed attentions such as these on a passing fancy. She saw her life rounding out like a fairy tale. Poor, coloured coloured in America; unknown, a nobody! And here at her hand was the forward thrust shadow of love and of great wealth. She would do lots of good among coloured people; she would see that Miss Powell, for instance, had her scholarship. Oh she would hunt out girls and men like Seymour Porter, she had almost forgotten his name, or was it Arthur Sawyer? and give them a taste of life in its fullness and beauty such as they had never dreamed of.  To-night she was to go out with Roger. She wore her flame-coloured dress again ; a pretty green one was also hanging up in her closet, but she wore the flame one because it lighted her up from within lighted not only her lovely, fine body but her mind too. Her satisfaction with her appearance let loose some inexplicable spring of gaiety and merriment and simplicity so that she seemed almost daring.  Roger, sitting opposite, tried to probe her mood, tried to gauge the invitation of her manner and its possibilities. She touched him once or twice, familiarly; he thought almost possessively. She seemed to be within reach now if along with that accessibility she had recklessness. It was this attribute which for the first time to-night he thought to divine within her. If in addition to her insatiable interest in life for she was always asking him about people and places, she possessed this recklessness, then indeed he might put to her a proposal which had been hanging on his lips for      weeks and months. Something innocent, pathetic ally untouched about her had hitherto kept him back. But if she had the requisite daring ! They were dining in East Tenth Street in a small cafe small contrasted with the Park Avenue Hotel to which he had first taken her. But about them stretched the glitter and perfection of crystal and silver, of marvellous napery and of obsequious service. Everything, Angela thought, looking about her, was translated. The slight odour of food was, she told Fielding, really an aroma: the mineral water which he was drinking be cause he could not help it and she because she could not learn to like wine, was nectar; the bread, the fish, the courses were ambrosia. The food, too, in general was to be spoken of as viands.  " Vittles, translated," she said laughing.  " And you, you, too, are translated. Angele, you are wonderful, you are charming," his lips answered but his senses beat and hammered. Intoxicated with the magic of the moment and the surroundings, she turned her smiling countenance a little nearer, and saw his face change, darken. A cloud over the sun.  " Excuse me," he said and walked hastily across the room back of her. In astonishment she turned and looked after him. At a table behind her three coloured people (under the direction of a puzzled and troubled waiter,) were about to take a table. Roger went up and spoke to the head- waiter authoritatively, even angrily. The latter glanced about the room, nodded obsequiously and crossing, addressed the little group. There was a hasty, slightly acrid discussion. Then the      three filled out, past Angela's table this time, their heads high.  She turned back to her plate, her heart sick. For her the evening was ended. Roger came back, his face flushed, triumphant, " Well I put a spoke in the wheel of those ' coons ' ! They forget themselves so quickly, coming in here spoiling white people's appetites. I told the manager if they brought one of their damned suits I'd be responsible. I wasn't going to have them here with you, Angele. I could tell that night at Martha Burden's by the way you looked at that girl that you had no time for darkies. I'll bet you'd never been that near to one before in your life, had you? Wonder where Martha picked that one up."  She was silent, lifeless. He went on recounting instances of how effectively he had " spoked the wheel " of various coloured people. He had black balled Negroes in Harvard, aspirants for small literary or honour societies. " I'd send 'em all back to Africa if I could. There's been a darkey up in Harlem's got the right idea, I understand; though he must be a low brute to cave in on his race that way; of course it's merely a matter of money with him. He'd betray them all for a few thousands. Gosh, if he could really pull it through I don't know but what I'd be willing to finance it."  To this tirade there were economic reasons to oppose, tenets of justice, high ideals of humanity. But she could think of none of them. Speechless, she listened to him, her appetite fled.  ' What's the matter, Angele? Did it make you sick to see them? "          " No, no not that. I I don't mind them; you're mistaken about me and that girl at Martha Burden's. It's you, you're so violent. I didn't know you were that way ! "  " And I've made you afraid of me? Oh, I don't want to do that." But he was flattered to think that he had affected her. " See here, let's get some air. I'll take you for a spin around the Park and then run you home."  But she did not want to go to the Park; she wanted to go home immediately. His little blue car was outside; in fifteen minutes they were at Jayne Street. She would not permit him to come inside, not even in the vestibule; she barely gave him her hand.  " But Angele, you can't leave me like this; why what have I done? Did it frighten you be cause I swore a little? But I'd never swear at you. Don't go like this."  She was gone, leaving him staring and non plussed on the sidewalk. Lighting a cigarette, he climbed back in her car. " Now what the devil ! " He shifted his gears. " But she likes me. I'd have sworn she liked me to-night. Those damn niggers ! I bet she's thinking about me this    He would have lost his bet. She was thinking about the coloured people.  She could visualize them all so plainly; she could interpret their changing expressions as com pletely as though those changes lay before her in a book. There were a girl and two men, one      young, the other the father perhaps of either of the other two. The fatherly-looking person, for so her mind docketed him, bore an expression of readiness for any outcome whatever. She knew and understood the type. His experiences of surprises engendered by this thing called prejudice had been too vast for them to appear to him as surprises. If they were served this was a lucky day; if not he would refuse to let the incident shake his stout spirit.  It was to the young man and the girl that her interest went winging. In the mirror behind Roger she had seen them entering the room and she had thought: " Oh, here are some of them fighting it out again. O God ! please let them be served, please don't let their evening be spoiled." She was so happy herself and she knew that the reception of fifty other maitres d'hotel could not atone for a rebuff at the beginning of the game. The young fellow was nervous, his face tense, thus might he have looked going to meet the enemy's charge in the recent Great War; but there the odds were even; here the cards were already stacked against him. Presently his ex pression would change for one of grimness, determination and despair. Talk of a lawsuit would follow; apparently did follow; still a law suit at best is a poor substitute for an evening's fun.  But the girl, the girl in whose shoes she herself might so easily have been ! She was so clearly a nice girl, with all that the phrase implies. To Angela watching her intently and yet with the in difference of safety she recalled Virginia, so slender, so appealing she was and so brave. So      very brave! Ah, that courage! It affected at first a gay hardihood: " Oh I know it isn't cus tomary for people like us to come into this cafe, but everything is going to be all right." It met Angela's gaze with a steadiness before which her own quailed, for she thought: " Oh, poor thing! perhaps she thinks that I don't want her either." And when the blow had fallen the courage had had to be translated anew into a comforting assurance. " Don't worry about me, Jimmy," the watching guest could just hear her. " Indeed, indeed it won't spoil the evening, I should say not; there're plenty of places where they'd be all right. We just happened to pick a lemon."  The three had filed out, their heads high, their gaze poised and level. But the net result of the evening's adventure would be an increased cyni cism in the elderly man, a growing bitterness for the young fellow, and a new timidity in the girl, who, even after they had passed into the street, could not relieve her feelings, for she must comfort her baffled and goaded escort.  Angela wondered if she had been half as con soling to Matthew Henson, was it just a short year ago? And suddenly, sitting immobile in her arm-chair, her evening cloak slipping unnoticed to the floor, triumph began to mount in her. Life could never cheat her as it had cheated that coloured girl this evening, as it had once cheated her in Philadephia with Matthew. She was free, free to taste life in all its fullness and sweetness, in all its minutest details. By exercising sufficient courage to employ the unique weapon which an accident of heredity had placed in her grasp she        was able to master life. How she blessed her mother for showing her the way ! In a country where colour or the lack of it meant the difference between freedom and fetters how lucky she was ! But, she told herself, she was through with Roger Fielding.          Now it was Spring, Spring in New York. Wash ington Square was a riot of greens that showed up bravely against the great red brick houses on its north side. The Arch viewed from Fifth Avenue seemed a gateway to Paradise. The long deep streets running the length of the city invited an exploration to the ends where pots of gold doubt less gleamed. On the short crosswise streets the April sun streamed in splendid banners of deep golden light.  In two weeks Angela had seen Roger only once. He telephoned every day, pleading, beseeching, entreating. On the one occasion when she did permit him to call there were almost tears in his eyes. " But, darling, what did I do? If you'd only tell me that. Perhaps I could explain away whatever it is that's come between us." But there was nothing to explain she told him gravely, it was just that he was harder, more cruel than she had expected; no, it wasn't the coloured people, she lied and felt her soul blushing, it was that now she knew him when he was angry or displeased, and she could see how ruthless, how determined he was to have things his way. His willingness to pay the costs of the possible lawsuit had filled her with a sharp fear. What could one do against a man, against a group of men such as he and his          kind represented who would spend time and money to maintain a prejudice based on a silly, time-worn tradition?  Yet she found she did not want to lose sight of him completely. The care, the attention, the flattery with which he had surrounded her were beginning to produce their effect. In the beautiful but slightly wearying balminess of the Spring she missed the blue car which had been constantly at her call; eating a good but homely meal in her little living room with the cooking odours fairly overwhelming her from the kitchenette, she found herself longing unconsciously for the dainty food, the fresh Spring delicacies which she knew he would be only too glad to procure for her. Shamefacedly she had to acknowledge that the separation which she was so rigidly enforcing meant a difference in her tiny exchequer, for it had now been many months since she had regularly taken her main meal by herself and at her own expense.  To-day she was especially conscious of her dependence upon him, for she was to spend the afternoon in Van Cortlandt Park with Anthony. There had been talk of subways and the Elevated. Roger would have had the blue car at the door and she would have driven out of Jayne Street in state. Now it transpired that Anthony was to deliver some drawings to a man, a tricky customer, whom it was best to waylay if possible on Saturday afternoon. Much as he regretted it he would probably be a little late. Angela, therefore, to save time must meet him at Seventy-second Street. Roger would never have made a request like that; he would have brought his lawyer or his business          man along in the car with him and, dismissing him with a curt " Well I'll see if I can finish this to-morrow," would have hastened to her with his best Walter Raleigh manner, and would have pro duced the cloak, too, if she would but say so. Per haps she'd have to take him back. Doubtless later on she could manage his prejudices if only he would speak. But how was she to accomplish that?  Still it was lovely being here with Anthony in the park, so green and fresh, so new with the recurring newness of Spring. Anthony touched her hand and said as he had once before, " I'm so content to be with you, Angel. I may call you Angel, mayn't I? You are that to me, you know. Oh if you only knew how happy it makes me to be content, to be satisfied like this. I could get down on my knees and thank God for it like a little boy." He looked like a little boy as he said it. " Happiness is a hard thing to find and harder still to keep."  She asked him idly, " Haven't you always been happy? "  His face underwent a startling change. Not only did the old sadness and strain come back on it, but a great bitterness such as she had never before seen.  " No," he said slowly as though thinking through long years of his life. " I haven't been happy for years, not since I was a little boy. Never once have I been happy nor even at ease until I met you."  But she did not want him to find his happiness in her. That way would only lead to greater un- happiness for him. So she said, to change the subject: " Could you tell me about it? "          But there was nothing to tell, he assured her, his face growing darker, grimmer. " Only my father was killed when I was a little boy, killed by his enemies. I've hated them ever since; I never stopped hating them until I met you." But this was just as dangerous a road as the other plus the possibilities of re-opening old wounds. So she only shivered and said vaguely, " Oh, that was terrible ! Too terrible to talk about. I'm sorry, Anthony ! " And then as a last desperate topic: "Are you ever going back to Brazil?" For she knew that he had come to the United States from Rio de Janeiro. He had spent Christ mas at her house, and had shown her pictures of the great, beautiful city and of his mother, a slender, dark-eyed woman with a perpetual sad ness in her eyes.  The conversation languished. She thought: " It must be terrible to be a man and to have these secret hates and horrors back of one." Some Spanish feud, a matter of hot blood and ready knives, a sudden stroke, and then this deadly memory for him.  " No," he said after a long pause. "I'm never going back to Brazil. I couldn't." He turned to her suddenly. " Tell me, Angel, what kind of girl are you, what do you think worth while? Could you, for the sake of love, for the sake of being loyal to the purposes and vows of someone you loved, bring yourself to endure privation and hardship and misunderstanding, hardship that would be none the less hard because it really could be avoided? "  She thought of her mother who had loved her father so dearly, and of the wash-days which she          had endured for him, the long years of household routine before she and Jinny had been old enough to help her first with their hands and then with their earnings. She thought of the little, dark, shabby house, of the made-over dresses and turned coats. And then she saw Roger and his wealth and his golden recklessness, his golden keys which could open the doors to beauty and ease and decency ! Oh, it wasn't decent for women to have to scrub and work and slave and bear children and sacrifice their looks and their pretty hands, she saw her mother's hands as they had always looked on wash day, they had a white, boiled appearance. No, she would not fool herself nor Anthony. She was no sentimentalist. It was not likely that she, a girl who had left her little sister and her home to go out to seek life and happiness would throw it over for poverty, hardship. If a man loved a woman how could he ask her that?  So she told him gently: " No, Anthony, I couldn't," and watched the blood drain from his face and the old look of unhappiness drift into his eyes.  He answered inadequately. " No, of course you couldn't." And turning over, he had been sitting on the grass at her feet he lay face downward on the scented turf. Presently he sat up and giving her a singularly sweet but wistful smile, said: " I almost touched happiness, Angele. Did you by any chance ever happen to read Browning's ( Two in the Roman Campagna '? "  But she had read very little poetry except what had been required in her High School work, and certainly not Browning.    \      He began to interpret the fragile, difficult beauty of the poem with its light but sure touch on evanescent, indefinable feeling. He quoted:  " How is it under our control To love or not to love? "  And again:  " Infinite yearning and the pang Of finite hearts that yearn."  They were silent for a long time. And again she wondered how it would feel to love. He watched the sun drop suddenly below some tree tops and rose to his feet shivering a little as though its disappearance had made him immediately cold.  " ' So the good moment goes.' Come, Angel, we'll have to hasten. It's getting dark and it's a long walk to the subway."    The memory of the afternoon stayed by her, shrouding her thoughts, clinging to them like a tenuous, adhering mantle. But she said to herself: " There's no use thinking about that. I'm not going to live that kind of life." And she knew she wanted Roger and what he could give her and the light and gladness which he always radiated. She wanted none of Anthony's poverty and priva tion and secret vows, he meant, she supposed, some promise to devote himself to REAL ART, her visual mind saw it in capitals. Well, she was sick of tragedy, she belonged to a tragic race.      " God knows it's time for one member of it to be having a little fun."  " Yes," she thought all through her class, paint ing furiously for she had taken up her work in earnest since Christmas " yes, I'll just make up my mind to it. I'll take Roger back and get mar ried and settle down to a pleasant, safe, beautiful life." And useful. It should be very useful. Perhaps she'd win Roger around to helping coloured people. She'd look up all sorts of down- and-outers and give them a hand. And she'd help Anthony, at least she'd offer to help him; she didn't believe he would permit her.  Coming out of the building a thought occurred to her: "Take Roger back, but back to what? To his old status of admiring, familiar, generous friend? Just that and no more? " Here was her old problem again. She stopped short to con sider it.  Martha Burden overtook her. " Planning the great masterpiece of the ages, Angele? Better come along and work it out by my fireside. I can give you some tea. Are you coming? "  " Yes," said Angela, still absorbed.  " Well," said Martha after they had reached the house. " I've never seen any study as deep as that. Come out of it Angele, you'll drown. You're not by any chance in love, are you? "  " No," she replied, " at least I don't know. But tell me, Martha, suppose suppose I were in love with one of them, what do you do about it, how do you get them to propose? "  Martha lay back and laughed. " Such candour have I not met, no, not in all Flapperdom. Angele^  K    if I could answer that I'd be turning women away from my door and handing out my knowledge to the ones I did admit at a hundred dollars a throw."  " But there must be some way. Oh, of course, I know lots of them propose, but how do you get a proposal from the ones you want, the, the interesting ones? "  " You really want to know? The only answer I can give you is Humpty Dumpty's dictum to Alice about verbs and adjectives: ' It depends on which is the stronger.' ' She interpreted for her young guest was clearly mystified. " It depends on (A) whether you are strong enough to make him like you more than you like him; (B) whether if you really do like him more than he does you you can conceal it. In other words, so far as liking is concerned you must always be ahead of the game, you must always like or appear to like him a little less than he does you. And you must make him want you. But you mustn't give. Oh yes, I know that men are always wanting women to give, but they don't want the women to want to give. They want to take, or at any rate to compel the giving."  " It sounds very complicated, like some subtle game."  A deep febrile light came into Martha's eyes. " It is a game, and the hardest game in the world for a woman, but the most fascinating; the hardest in which to strike a happy medium. You see, you have to be careful not to withhold too much and yet to give very little. If we don't give enough we lose them. If we give too much we lose our selves. Oh, Angele, God doesn't like women."        " But," said Angela thinking of her own mother, " there are some women who give all and men like them the better for it."  " Oh, yes, that's true. Those are the blessed among women. They ought to get down on their knees every 'day and thank God for permitting them to be their normal selves and not having to play a game." For a moment her still, proud face broke into deeps of pain. " Oh, Angele, think of loving and never, never being able to show it until you're asked for it; think of living a game every hour of your life ! " Her face quivered back to its normal immobility.  Angela walked home through the purple twi light musing no longer on her own case but on this unexpected revelation. " Well," she said, "I certainly shouldn't like to love like that." She thought of Anthony : " A woman could be her true self with him." But she had given him up.    If the thing to do were to play a game she would play one. Indeed she rather enjoyed the prospect. She was playing a game now, a game against public tradition on the one hand and family instinct on the other; the stakes were happiness and excitement, and almost anyone looking at the tricks which she had already taken would prophesy that she would be the winner. She decided to follow all the rules as laid down by Martha Burden and to add any workable ideas of her own. When Roger called again she was still unable to see him, but her voice was a shade less curt over the telephone; she did not cut him      H-  off so abruptly. " I must not withhold too much," she reminded herself. He was quick to note the subtle change in intonation. " But you're going to let me come to see you soon, Angele," he pleaded. " You wouldn't hold out this way against me forever. Say when I may come."  " Oh, one of these days; I must go now, Roger. Good-bye."  After the third call she let him come to spend Friday evening. She heard the blue car rumbling in the street and a few minutes later he came literally staggering into the living-room so laden was he with packages. Flowers, heaps of spring posies had come earlier in the day, lilacs, jonquils, narcissi. Now this evening there were books and candy, handkerchiefs, " they were so dainty and they looked just like you," he said fearfully, for she had never taken an article of dress from him, two pictures, a palette and some fine brushes and last a hamper of all sorts of delicacies. " I thought if you didn't mind we'd have supper here; it would be fun with just us two."  How much he pleased her he could not divine; it was the first time he had ever given a hint of any desire for sheer domesticity. Anthony had sought nothing better than to sit and smoke and watch her flitting about in her absurd red or violet apron. Matthew Henson had been speech less with ecstasy when on a winter night she had allowed him to come into the kitchen while she prepared for him a cup of cocoa. But Roger's palate had been so flattered by the concoctions of chefs famous in London, Paris and New York that he had set no store by her simple cooking.      Indeed his inevitable comment had been: " Here, what do you want to get yourself all tired out for? Let's go to a restaurant. It's heaps less bother."  But to-night he, too, watched her with humble, delighted eyes. She realized that he was con scious of her every movement; once he tried to embrace her, but she whirled out of his reach without reproach but with decision. He subsided, too thankful to be once more in her presence to take any risks. And when he left he had kissed her hand.  She began going about with him again, but with condescension, with kindness. And with the new vision gained from her talk with Martha she could see his passion mounting. " Make him want you," that was the second rule. It was clear that he did, no man could be as persevering as this other wise. Still he did not speak. They were to meet that afternoon in front of the school to go " any where you want, dear, Pm yours to command ". It was the first time that he had called for her at the building, and she came out a litttle early, for she did not want any of the three, Martha, Paulette, nor Anthony, to see whom she was meeting. It would be better to walk to the corner, she thought, they'd be just that much less likely to recognize him. She heard footsteps hurrying behind her, heard her name and turned to see Miss Powell, pleased and excited. She laid her hand on Angela's arm but the latter shook her off. Roger must not see her on familiar terms like this with a coloured girl for she felt that the afternoon portended something and she wanted no side issues. The coloured girl gave her a penetrating        glance; then her habitual reserve settled down blotting out the eagerness, leaving her face blurred and heavy. " I beg your pardon, Miss Mory, I'm sure," she murmured and stepped out into the tempestuous traffic of Fourth Avenue. Angela was sorry; she would make it up to-morrow, she thought, but she had not dismissed her a moment too soon for Roger came rushing up, his car resplendent and resplendent himself in a grey suit, soft grey hat and blue tie. Angela looked at him approvingly. " You look just like the men in the advertising pages of the Saturday Evening Post," she said, and the fact that he did not wince under the compliment proved the depth of his devotion, for every one of his outer garments, hat, shoes, and suit, had been made to measure.  They went to Coney Island. " The ocean will be there, but very few people and only a very few amusements," said Roger. They had a delightful time; they were like school children, easily and frankly amused; they entered all the booths that were open, ate pop-corn and hot dogs and other local dainties. And presently they were flying home under the double line of trees on Ocean Parkway and entering the bosky loveli ness of Prospect Park. Roger slowed down a little.  "Oh," said Angela. "I love this car."  He bent toward her instantly. " Does it please you? Did you miss it when you made me stay away from you? "  She was afraid she had made a mistake: " Yes, but that's not why I let you come back."  " I know that. But you do like it, don't you, comfort and beauty and dainty surroundings? "          " Yes," she said solemnly, " I love them all."  He was silent then for a long, long time, his face a little set, a worried line on his forehead.  " Well now what's he thinking about? " she asked herself, watching his hands and their clever manipulation of the steering wheel though his thoughts, she knew, were not on that.  He turned to her with an air of having made up his mind. " Angele, I want you to promise to spend a day out riding with me pretty soon. I I have something I want to say to you." He was a worldly young man about town but he was actually mopping his brow. " I've got to go south for a week for my father, he owns some timber down there with which he used to supply saw mills but since the damned niggers have started running north it's been something of a weight on his hands. He wants me to go down and see whether it's worth his while to hold on to it any longer. It's so rarely that he asks anything of me along a business line that I'd hate to refuse him. But I'll be back the morning of the twenty-sixth. I'll have to spend the afternoon and evening with him out on Long Island but on the twenty-seventh could you go out with me? "  She said as though all this preamble portended nothing: " I couldn't give you the whole day, but I'd go in the afternoon."  " Oh," his face fell a little. " Well, the after noon then. Only of course we won't be able to go far out. Perhaps you'd like me to arrange a lunch and we'd go to one of the Parks, Central or the Bronx, or Van Cortlandt, - "  " No, not Van Cortlandt," she told him. That park was sacred to Anthony Cross.      " Well, wherever you say. We can settle it even that day. The main thing is that you'll  go."  She said to herself. "Aren't men funny! He could have asked me five times over while he was making all these arrangements." But she was immensely relieved, even happy. She felt very kindly toward him; perhaps she was in love after all, only she was not the demonstrative kind. It was too late for him to come in, but they sat in the car in the dark security of Jayne Street and she let him take her in his arms and kiss her again again. For the first time she returned his kisses.    Weary but triumphant she mounted the stairs almost stumbling from a sudden, overwhelming fatigue. She had been under a strain ! But it was all over now; she had conquered, she had been the stronger. She had secured not only him but an assured future, wealth, protection, influence, even power. She herself was power, like the women one reads about, like Cleopatra, Cleo patra's African origin intrigued her, it was a fitting comparison. Smiling, she took the last steep stairs lightly, springily, suddenly rein vigor ated.  As she opened the door a little heap of letters struck her foot. Switching on the light she sat in the easy chair and incuriously turned them over. They were bills for the most part, she had had to dress to keep herself dainty and desirable for Roger. At the bottom of the heap was a letter from Virginia. When she became Mrs. Roger Fielding    she would never have to worry about a bill again; how she would laugh when she remembered the small amounts for which these called! Never again would she feel the slight quake of dismay which always overtook her when she saw she words : " Miss Angele Mory in account with, " Out side of the regular monthly statement for gas she had never seen a bill in her father's house. Well, she'd have no difficulty in getting over her squeamish training.  Finally she opened Jinny's letter. Her sister had written:  " Angela I'm coming up for an exam, on the twenty-eighth. I'll arrive on the twenty-sixth or I could come the day before. You'll meet me, won't you? I know where I'm going to stay," she gave an address on isgth Street " but I don't know how to get there; I don't know your school hours, write and tell me so I can arrive when you're free. There's no reason why I should put you out."  So Virginia was really coming to try her luck in New York. It would be nice to have her so near. " Though I don't suppose we'll be seeing so much of each other," she thought, absently reaching for her schedule. " Less than ever now, for I suppose Roger and I will live in Long Island; yes, that would be much wiser. I'll wear a veil when I go to meet her, for those coloured porters stare at you so and they never forget you."  The twenty-seventh came on Thursday; she had classes in the morning ; well, Jinny would be coming in the afternoon anyway, and after twelve she had, Oh heavens that was the day, the day she was to      go out with Roger, the day that he would put the great question. And she wrote to Virginia:  " Come the twenty-sixth. Honey, any time after four. I couldn't possibly meet you on the twenty- seventh. But the twenty-sixth is all right. Let me know when your train comes in and I'll be there. And welcome to our city."          THE week was one of tumult, almost of agony. After all, matters were not completely settled, you never could tell. She would be glad when the twenty-seventh had come and gone, for then, then she would be rooted, fixed. She and Roger would marry immediately. But now he was so far away, in Georgia ; she missed him and evidently he missed her for the first two days brought her long tele grams almost letters. " I can think of nothing but next Thursday, are you thinking of it too? " The third day brought a letter which said practically the same thing, adding, " Oh, Angele, I wonder what you will say ! "  " But he could ask me and find out," she said to herself and suddenly felt assured and triumphant. Every day thereafter brought her a letter reiterat ing this strain. " And I know how he hates to write ! "  The letter on Wednesday read, " Darling, when you get this I'll actually be in New York; if I can I'll call you up but I'll have to rush like mad so as to be free for Thursday, so perhaps I can't manage."  She made up her mind not to answer the tele phone even if it did ring, she would strike one last note of indifference though only she herself would be aware of it.          It was the day on which Jinny was to arrive. It would be fun to see her, talk to her, hear all the news about the queer, staid people whom she had left so far behind. Farther now than ever. Matthew Henson was still in the post-office, she knew. Arthur Sawyer was teaching at Sixteenth and Fitzwater; she could imagine the sick distaste that mantled his face every time he looked at the hideous, discoloured building. Porter had taken his degree in dentistry but he was not prac tising, on the contrary he was editing a small weekly, getting deeper, more and more hopelessly into debt she was sure. ... It would be fun some day to send him a whopping cheque; after all, he had taken a chance just as she had; she recognized his revolt as akin to her own, only he had not had her luck. She must ask Jinny about all this.  It was too bad that she had to meet her sister, but she must. Just as likely as not she'd be car sick and then New York was terrifying for the first time to the stranger, she had known an instant's sick dread herself that first day when she had stood alone and ignorant in the great rotunda of the station. But she was different from Jinny; nothing about life ever made her really afraid; she might hurt herself, suffer, meet disappointment, but life could not alarm her; she loved to come to grips with it, to force it to a standstill, to yield up its treasures. But Jinny although brave, had secret fears, she was really only a baby. Her little sister ! For the first time in months she thought of her with a great surge of sisterly tenderness.  It was time to go. She wore her most un-        obtrusive clothes, a dark blue suit, a plain white silk shirt, a dark blue, bell-shaped hat a cloche small and fitting down close over her eyes. She pulled it down even farther and settled her modish veil well over the tip of her nose. It was one thing to walk about the Village with Miss Powell. There were practically no coloured people there. But this was different. Those curious porters should never be able to recognize her. Seymour Porter had worked among them one summer at Broad Street station in Philadel phia. He used to say : " They aren't really curious, you know, but their job makes them sick; so they're always hunting for the romance, for the adventure which for a day at least will take the curse off the monotonous obsequiousness of their lives."  She was sorry for them, but she could not permit them to remedy their existence at her expense.    In her last letter she had explained to Jinny about those two troublesome staircases which lead from the train level of the New York Pennsyl vania Railroad ^station to] the street level. ;< There's no use my trying to tell you which one to take in order to bring you up to the right hand or to the left hand side of the elevator because I never know myself. So all I can say, dear, is when you do get up to the elevator just stick to it and eventually I'll see you or you'll see me as I revolve around it. Don't you move, for it might turn out that we were both going in the same direction."        True to her own instructions, she was stationed between the two staircases, jerking her neck now toward one staircase, now toward the other, stopping short to look at the elevator itself. She thrust up her veil to see better.  A man sprinted by in desperate haste, brush ing so closely by her that the corner of his suit-case struck sharply on the thin inner curve of her knee.  " My goodness ! " she exclaimed involuntarily.  For all his haste he was a gentleman, for he pulled off his hat, threw her a quick backward glance and began: "I beg your why darling, darling, you don't mean to say you came to meet me ! "  " Meet you ! I thought you came in this morning." It was Roger, Roger and the sight of him made her stupid with fear.  He stooped and kissed her, tenderly, possess ively. " I did, oh Angela you are a beauty ! Only a beauty can wear plain things like that. I did come in this morning but I'm trying to catch Kirby, my father's lawyer, he ought to be coming in from Newark just now and I thought I'd take him down to Long Island with me for the night. I've got a lot of documents for him here in this suitcase that Georgia business was most complicated that way I won't have to hunt him up in the morning and I'll have more time to to arrange for our trip in the afternoon. What are you doing here? "  What was she doing there? Waiting for her sister Jinny who was coloured and who showed it. And Roger hated Negroes. She was lost, ruined, unless she could get rid of him. She told the first lie that came into her mind,        " I'm waiting for Paulette." All this could be fixed up with Paulette later. Miss Lister would think as little of deceiving a man, any man, as she would of squashing a mosquito. They were fair game and she would ask no questions.  His face clouded. " Can't say I'm so wild about your waiting for Paulette. Well we can wait together is she coming up from Philadelphia? That train's bringing my man too from Newark." He had the male's terrible clarity of under standing for train connections.  ' What time does your train go to Long Island? I thought you wanted to get the next one."  " Well, I'd like to but they're only half an hour apart. I can wait. Better the loss of an hour to-day than all of to-morrow morning. We can wait together; see the people are beginning to come up. I wish I could take you home but the minute he shows up I'll have to sprint with him."  " Now God be on my side," she prayed. Sometimes these trains were very long. If Mr. Kirby were in the first car and Jinny toward the end that would make all of ten minutes' difference. If only she hadn't given those explicit directions !  There was Jinny, her head suddenly emerging into view above the stairs. She saw Angela, waved her hand. In another moment she would be flinging her arms about her sister's neck; she would be kissing her and saying, " Oh, Angela, Angela darling ! "  And Roger, who was no fool, would notice the name Angela Angele; he would know no Coloured girl would make a mistake like this.          She closed her eyes in a momentary faintness, opened them again.  " What's the matter? " said Roger sharply, " are you sick? "  Jinny was beside her. Now, now the bolt would fall. She heard the gay, childish voice saying laughingly, assuredly:  " I beg your pardon, but isn't this Mrs. Hen rietta Jones? "  Oh, God was good ! Here was one chance if only Jinny would understand ! In his astonish ment Roger had turned from her to face the speaker. Angela, her eyes beseeching her sister's from under her close hat brim, could only stammer the old formula: " Really you have the advantage of me. No, I'm not Mrs. Jones."  Roger said rudely, " Of course she isn't Mrs. Jones. Come, Angle." Putting his arm through hers he stooped for the suitcase.  But Jinny, after a second's bewildered but incredulous stare, was quicker even than they. Her slight figure, her head high, preceded them; vanished into a telephone booth. ^fRoger glared after her. " Well of all the damned cheek ! "    For the first time in the pursuit of her chosen ends she began to waver. Surely no ambition, no pinnacle of safety was supposed to call fpr the sacrifice of a sister. She might be selfish, oh, undoubtedly she had been selfish all these months to leave Jinny completely to herself but she had never meant to be cruel. She tried to picture the          tumult of emotions in her sister's mind, there must have been amazement, oh she had seen it all on her face, the utter bewilderment, the incredu lity and then the settling down on that face of a veil of dignity and pride like a baby trying to harden its mobile features. She was in her apart ment again now, pacing the floor, wondering what to do. Already she had called up the house in  th Street, it had taken her a half-hour to get the number for she did not know the householder's name and " Information " had been coy, but Miss Murray had not arrived yet. Were they expecting her? Yes, Miss Murray had written to say that she would be there between six and seven ; it was seven-thirty now and she had not appeared. Was there any message? " No, no! " Angela ex plained she would call again.  But where was Jinny? She couldn't be lost, after all she was grown-up and no fool, she could ask directions. Perhaps she had taken a cab and in the evening traffic had been delayed, or had met with an accident. This thought sent Angela to the telephone again. There was no Miss Murray as yet. In her wanderings back and forth across the room she caught sight of herself in the mirror. Her face was flushed, her eyes shining with remorse and anxiety. Her vanity reminded her: " If Roger could just see me now ". Roger and to-morrow ! He would have to speak words of gold to atone for this breach which for his sake she had made in her sister's trust and aflecton.  At the end of an hour she called again. Yes, Miss Murray had come in. So great was her relief that her knees sagged under her. Yes of L      course they would ask her to come to the telephone. After a long silence the voice rang again over the wire. " I didn't see her go out but she must have for she's not in her room."  " Oh all right," said Angela, " the main thing was to know that she was there." But she was astonished. Jinny's first night in New York and she was out already ! She could not go to see her Thursday because of the engagement with Roger, but she'd make good the next day; she'd be there the first thing, Friday morning. Snatching up a sheet of note-paper she began a long letter full of apologies and excuses. " And I can't come to-morrow, darling, because as I told you I have a very important engagement, an engagement that means very much to me. Oh you'll under stand when I tell you about it." She put a special delivery stamp on the letter.  Her relief at learning that Jinny was safe did not ease her guilty conscience. In a calmer mood she tried now to find excuses for herself, extenuat ing circumstances. As soon as Jinny understood all that was involved she would overlook it. After all, Jinny would want her to be happy. " And anyway," she thought to herself sulkily j " Mamma didn't speak to Papa that day that we were stand ing on the steps of the Hotel Walton." But she knew that the cases were not analogous; no prin ciple was involved, her mother's silence had not exposed her husband to insult or con tumely, whereas Roger's attitude to Virginia had been distinctly offensive. " And moreover," her thoughts continued with merciless clarity, " when a principle was at stake your mother never hesi tated a moment to let those hospital attendants        know of the true status of affairs. In fact she was not aware that she was taking any particular stand. Her husband was her husband and she was glad to acknowledge that relationship."  A sick distaste for her action, for her daily decep tion, for Roger and his prejudices arose within her. But with it came a dark anger against a country and a society which could create such an issue. And she thought: " If I had spoken to Jinny, had acknowledged her, what good would it have done me or her either? After it was all over she would have been exactly where she was before and I would have lost everything. And I do so want to be happy, to have a good time. At this very hour to-morrow I'll probably be one of the most envied girls in New York. And afterwards I can atone for it all. I'll be good to all sorts of people; I'll really help humanity, lots of coloured folks will be much better off on account of me. And if I had spoken to Jinny I could never have helped them at all." Once she murmured: "I'll help Jinny too, the darling ! She shall have everything in the world she wants." But in her heart she knew already that Jinny would want nothing.          THURSDAY came and Thursday sped as Thursdays will. For a long time Angela saw it as a little separate entity of time shut away in some hidden compartment of her mind, a compartment whose door she dreaded to open.  On Friday she called up her sister early in the morning. " Is that you, Jinny? Did you get my letter? Is it all right for me to come up?"  " Yes," said Jinny noncomittally, to all questions, then laconically: "But you'd better come right away if you want to catch me. I take the exam ination to-day and haven't much time."  Something in the matter-of-factness of her reply disconcerted Angela. Yet there certainly was no reason why her sister should show any enthusiasm over seeing her. Only she did want to see her, to talk to some one of her very own to-day. She would like to burrow her head in Virginia's shoulder and cry! But a mood such as Jinny's voice indicated did not invite confidences.  A stout brown-skinned bustling woman suggest ing immense assurance and ability opened the door. " Miss Murray told me that she was expecting some one. You're to go right on up. Her's is the room right next to the third storey front."      " She was expecting someone." Evidently Virginia had been discreet. This unexpected, unsought for carefulness carried a sting with it.  " Hello/' said Jinny, casually thrusting a dishev elled but picturesque head out of the door. " Can you find your way in? This room's larger than any two we ever had at home, yet already it looks like a ship at sea." She glanced about the dis ordered place. " I wonder if this is what they mean by s shipshape '. Here I'll hang up this suit, then you can sit down. Isn't it a sweetie? Got it at Snellenburg's."  She had neither kissed nor offered to shake hands with her sister, yet her manner was friendly enough, even cordial. " See I've bobbed my hair," she went on. " Like it? I'm wild about it even if it does take me forever to fix it." Stand ing before a mirror she began shaping the ends under with a curling iron.  Angela thought she had never seen any one so pretty and so colourful. Jinny had always shown a preference for high colours; to-day she was revelling in them; her slippers were high heeled small red mules; a deep green dressing-gown hung gracefully from her slim shoulders and from its open collar flamed the rose and gold of her smooth skin. Her eyes were bright and dancing. Her hair, black, alive and curling, ended in a thick velvety straightness like cut plush.  Angela said stiffly, " I hope I didn't get you up, telephoning so early."  Virginia smiled, flushing a little more deeply under the dark gold of her skin. " Oh dear no ! I'd already had an earlier call than that this morn- ing."          " You had ! " exclaimed Angela, astonished. " I didn't know you knew anyone in New York." She remembered her sister's mysterious disap pearance the first night of her arrival. " And see here, Jinny, Pm awfully sorry about what hap pened the other night. I wouldn't have had it happen for a great deal. I wish I could explain to you about it." How confidently she had counted on having marvellous news to tell Vir ginia and now how could she drag to the light yesterday's sorry memory? "But I called you up again and again and you hadn't arrived and then when they finally did tell me that you had come, it appeared that you had gone out. Where on earth did you go? "  Jinny began to laugh, to giggle in fact. For a moment she was the Virginia of her school days, rejoicing in some innocent mischief, full of it. "I wasn't out. There's a wash-room down the hall and I went there to wash my face, -- " it clouded a moment. " And when I came back I walked as I thought into my room. Instead of that I had walked into the room of another lodger. And there he sat -- "  " Oh," said Angela inattentively. " I'm glad you weren't out. I was quite worried. Listen, Virginia," she began desperately, " I know you think that what I did in the station the other day was unspeakable; it seems almost impossible for me to explain it to you. But that man with me was a very special friend, -- "  " He must have been indeed," Jinny inter rupted drily, " to make you cut your own sister." She was still apparently fooling with her hair, her head perched on one side, her eyes glued to the        mirror. But she was not making much progress and her lips were trembling.  Angela proceeded unheeding, afraid to stop. " A special friend, and we had come to a very crucial point in our relationship. It was with him that I had the engagement yesterday.'  " Well, what about it? Were you expecting him to ask you to marry him? Did he? "  " No," said Angela very low, " that's just what he didn't do though he, he asked everything else."  Virginia, dropping the hair-brush, swung about sharply. " And you let him talk like that? "  " I couldn't help it once he had begun, I was so taken by surprise, and, besides, I think that his ultimate intentions are all right."  " His ultimate intentions ! Why, Angela what are you talking about? You know perfectly well what his ultimate intentions are. Isn't he a white man? Well, what kind of intentions would he have toward a coloured woman? "  " Simple ! He doesn't know I'm coloured. And besides some of them are decent. You must remember that I know something about these people and you don't, you couldn't, living that humdrum little life of yours at home."  " I know enough about them and about men in general to recognize an insult when I hear one. Some men bear their character stamped right on their faces. Now this man into whose room t walked last night by mistake, "  " I don't see how you can do very much talking walking into strange men's rooms at ten o'clock at night."          The triviality of the retort left Jinny dumb. It was their first quarrel.    They sat in silence for a few minutes, for several minutes. Virginia, apparently completely com posed, was letting the tendrils of her mind reach far, far out to the ultimate possibilities of this impasse in relationship between herself and her sister. She thought: " I really have lost her, she's really gone out of my ken just as I used to lose her years ago when father and I would be singing 'The Dying Christian '. I'm twenty-three years old and I'm really all alone in the world." Up to this time she had always felt she had Angela's greater age and supposedly greater wisdom to fall back on, but she banished this conjecture forever. " Because if she could cut me when she hadn't seen me for a year for the sake of a man who she must have known meant to insult her, she certainly has no intention of openly acknowledging me again. And I don't believe I want to be a sister in secret. I hate this hole and corner busi ness."  She saw again the scene in the station, herself at first so serene, so self-assured, Angela's confused coldness, Roger's insolence. Something hardened, grew cold within her. Even his arrogance had failed to bring Angela to her senses, and suddenly she remembered that it had been possible in slavery times for white men and women to mistreat their mulatto relations, their own flesh and blood, selling them into deeper slavery in the far South or stand ing by watching them beaten, almost, if not com-      pletely, to death. Perhaps there was something fundamentally different between white and coloured blood after all. Aloud she said : " You know before you went away that Sunday morning you said that you and I were different. Perhaps you're right, Angela; perhaps there is an extra infusion of white blood in your veins which lets you see life at another angle. If that's the case I have no right to judge you. You must forgive my ignorant comments."  She began slipping into a ratine dress of old blue trimmed with narrow collars and cuffs and a tiny belt of old rose. Above the soft shades the bronze and black of her head etched themselves sharply; she might have been a dainty bird of Paradise cast in a new arrangement of colours but her tender face was set in strange and implacable lines.  Angela looked at her miserably. She had not known just what, in her wounded pride and humiliation, she had expected to gain from her sister, but certainly she had hoped for some balm. And in any event not this cool aloofness. She had forgotten that her sister might be suffering from a wound as poignant as her own. The year had made a greater breach than she had anticipated; she had never been as outspoken, as frank with Virginia as the latter had been with her, but there had always been a common ground between them, a meeting place. In the household Jinny had had something of a reputation for her willingness to hear all sides of a story, to find an excuse or make one.  An old aphorism of Hetty Daniels returned to her. " He who would have friends must show himself friendly." And she had done anything          but that; she had neglected Jinny, had failed to answer her letters, had even planned, was it only day before yesterday ! to see very little of her in what she had dreamed would be her new sur roundings. Oh she had been shameful ! But she would make it up to Jinny now and then she could come to her at this, this crisis in her life which so frightened and attracted her. She was the more frightened because she felt that attraction. She would make her sister understand the desires and longings which had come to her in this strange, dear, free world, and then together they would map out a plan of action. Jinny might be a baby but she had strength. So much strength, said something within her, that just as likely as not she would say: " Let the whole thing go, Angela, Angela! You don't want to be even on the out skirts of a thing like this."  Before she could begin her overtures Jinny was speaking. " Listen, Angela, I've got to be going. I don't know when we'll be seeing each other again, and after what happened Wednesday you can hardly expect me to be looking you up, and as you doubtless are very busy you'd hardly be coming 'way up here. But there are one or two things I want to talk to you about. First about the house."  " About the house? Why it's yours. I've nothing more to do with it."  " I know, but I'm thinking of selling it. There is such a shortage of houses in Philadel phia just now; Mr. Hallowell says I can get at least twice as much as father paid for it. And in that case you've some more money coming to you."      If only she had known of this, when? twenty- four hours earlier, how differently she might have received Roger's proposition. If she had met Vir ginia Wednesday and had had the talk for which she had planned!  " Well of course it would be awfully nice to have some more money. But what I don't understand is how are you going to live? What are you going to do? "  " If I pass this examination I'm coming over here, my appointment would be only a matter of a few months. I'm sure of that. This is May and I'd only have to wait until September. Well, I wouldn't be working this summer anyway. And there's no way in the world which I could fail to pass. In fact I'm really thinking of taking a chance and coming over here to substitute. Mr. Holloster, the University of Pennsylvania man, has been investigating and he says there's plenty of work. And I guess I'm due to have a change; New York rather appeals to me. And there cer tainly is something about Harlem ! " In spite of her careless manner Angela knew she was thinking about Matthew Henson. She stretched out her hand, pulled Jinny's head down on her shoulder. " Oh darling, don't worry about him. Matthew really wasn't the man for you."  " Well," said Virginia, " as long as I think he was, the fact that he wasn't doesn't make any real difference, does it? At least not at first. But I certainly shan't worry about it."  " No don't, I, " It was on the tip of her  tongue to say " I know two or three nice young men whom you can play around with. I'll intro duce you to them." But could she? Jinny      understood her silence; smiled and nodded. " It's all right, honey, you can't do anything; you would if you could. We've just got to face the fact that you and I are two separate people and we've got to live our lives apart, not like the Siamese twins. And each of us will have to go her chosen way. After all each of us is seeking to get all she can out of life ! and if you can get more out of it by being white, as you undoubtedly can, why, why shouldn't you? Only it seems to me that there are certain things in living that are more fundamental even than colour, but I don't know. I'm all mixed up. But evidently you don't feel that way, and you're just as likely to be right as    me."    "Jinny!"  " My dear, I'm not trying to reproach you. I'm trying to look at things without sentiment. After all, in a negative way, merely by saying nothing, you're disclaiming your black blood in a country where it is an inconvenience, oh ! there's not a doubt about that. You may be proud of it, you may be perfectly satisfied with it I am but it certainly can shut you out of things. So why shouldn't you disclaim a living manifestation of that blood? "  Before this cool logic Angela was silent. Virginia looked at her sister, a maternal look oddly apparent on her young face. When she was middle-aged she would be the embodiment of motherhood. How her children would love her !  " Angela, you'll be careful ! "  " Yes, darling. Oh if only I could make you understand what it's all about."  ' Yes, well, perhaps another time. I've got to          fly now." She hesitated, took Angela by the arms and gazed into her eyes. " About this grand white party that you were in the station with. Are you awfully in love with him? "  " Fm not in love with him at all."  " Oh, pshaw ! " said innocent Virginia, " you've got nothing to worry about! Why, what's all the shooting for? "        PLUM      ANGELA wanted to ride downtown with her sister. " Perhaps I might bring you luck." But on this theme Jinny was adamant. " You'd be much more likely to bring yourself bad luck. No, there's no sense in taking a chance. I'll take the elevated; my landlady said it would drop me very near the school where I'm taking the exam ination. You go some other way." Down in the hall Mrs. Gloucester was busy dusting, her short bustling figure alive with housewifely ardour. Virginia paused near her and held out her hand to Angela. " Good-bye, Miss Mory," she said wickedly, " it was very kind of you to give me so much time. If you can ever tear yourself away from your beloved Village, come up and I'll try to show you Harlem. I don't think it's going to take me long to learn it."  Obediently Angela let her go her way and walk ing over to Seventh Avenue mounted the 'bus, smarting a little under Jinny's generous pre cautions. But presently she began to realize their value, for at One Hundred and Fourteenth Street Anthony Cross entered. He sat down beside her. " I never expected to see you in my neighbour hood."  " Oh is this where you live? I've often won dered."    ^  " As it happens I've just come here, but I've lived practically all over New York." He was thin, restless, unhappy. His eyes dwelt cease lessly on her face. She said a little nervously:  " It seems to me I hardly ever see you any more. What do you do with yourself? "  " Nothing that you would be interested in."  She did not dare make the obvious reply and after all, though she did like him very much, she was not interested in his actions. For a long moment she sought for some phrase which would express just the right combination of friendliness and indifference.  " It's been a long time since we've had lunch together; come and have it to-day with me. You be my guest." She thought of Jinny and the possible sale of the house. " I've just found out that I'm going to get a rather decent amount of money, certainly enough to stand us for lunch."  " Thank you, I have an engagement; besides I don't want to lunch with you in public."  This was dangerous ground. Flurried, she replied unwisely: " All right, come in some time for tea; every once in a while I make a batch of cookies ; I made some a week ago. Next time I feel the mood coming on me I'll send you a card and you can come and eat them, hot and hot."  " You know you've no intention of doing any such thing. Besides you don't know my address."  " An inconvenience which can certainly be rectified," she laughed at him.  But he was in no laughing mood. " I've no cards with me, but they wouldn't have the address anyway." He tore a piece of paper out of his        notebook, scribbled on it. " Here it is. I have to get off now." He gave her a last despairing look. " Oh, Angel, you know you're never going to send for me ! "  The bit of paper clutched firmly in one hand, she arrived finally at her little apartment. Natur ally of an orderlv turn of mind she looked about for her address book in which to write the street and number. But some unexplained impulse led her to smooth the paper out and place it in a corner of her desk. That done she took off her hat and gloves, sat down in the comfortable chair and prepared to face her thoughts.    Yesterday ! Even now at a distance of twenty- four hours she had not recovered her equilibrium. She was still stunned, still unable to realize the happening of the day. Only she knew that she had reached a milestone in her life; a possible turning point. If she did not withdraw from her acquaintanceship with Roger now, even though she committed no overt act she would never be the same ; she could never again face herself with the old, unshaken pride and self-confidence. She would never be the same to herself. If she with drew, then indeed, indeed she would be the same old Angela Murray, the same girl save for a little sophistication that she had been before she left Philadelphia, only she would have started on an adventure and would not have seen it to its finish, she would have come to grips with life and would have laid down her arms at the first onslaught. Would she be a coward or a wise, wise woman?        She thought of two poems that she had read in " Hart's Glass-Book ", an old, old book of her father's, one of them ran:  'He either fears his fate too much  Or his deserts are small, Who dares not put it to the touch For fear of losing all.'  The other was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cowardice:  'He who fights and runs away  Shall live to fight another day But he who is in battle slain Has fallen ne'er to rise again.'  Were her deserts small or should she run away and come back to fight another day when she was older, more experienced? More experienced! How was she to get that experience? Already she was infinitely wiser, she would, if occasion required it, exercise infinitely more wariness than she had yesterday with Roger. Yet it was precisely be cause of that experience that she would know how to meet, would even know when to expect similar conditions.  She thought that she knew which verse she would follow if she were Jinny, but, back once more in the assurance of her own rooms, she knew that she did not want to be Jinny, that she and Jinny were two vastly different persons. " But," she said to herself, " if Jinny were as fair as I and yet herself and placed in the same conditions as those in which I am placed her colour would save          her. It's a safeguard for Jinny; it's always been a curse for me."    Roger had come for her in the blue car. There were a hamper and two folding chairs and a rug stored away in it. It was a gorgeous day. " If we can," he said, " we'll picnic." He was ex tremely handsome and extremely nervous. Angela was nervous too, though she did not show it except in the loss of her colour. She was rather plain to-day; to be so near the completion of her goal and yet to have to wait these last few agonizing moments, perhaps hours, was deadly. They were rather silent for a while, Roger intent on his driv ing. Traffic in New York is a desperate strain at all hours, at eleven in the morning it is deadly; the huge leviathan of a city is breaking into the last of its stride. For a few hours it will proceed at a measured though never leisurely pace and then burst again into the mad rush of the home ward bound.  But at last they were out of the city limits and could talk. For the first time since she had known him he began to speak of his possessions. " Any thing, anything that money can buy, Angele, I can get and I can give." His voice was charged with intention. They were going in the direction of Forest Hills ; he had a cottage out there, perhaps she would like to see it. And there was a grove not far away. " We'll picnic there," he said, " and and talk." He certainly was nervous, Angela thought, and liked him the better for it.          The cottage or rather the house in Forest Hills was beautiful, absolutely a gem. And it was completely furnished with taste and marked dainti ness. " What do you keep it furnished for? " asked Angela wondering. Roger murmured that it had been empty for a long time but he had seen this equipment and it had struck him that it was just the thing for this house so he had bought it; thereby insensibly reminding his com panion again that he could afford to gratify any whim. They drove away from the exquisite little place in silence. Angela was inclined to be amused; surely no one could have asked for a better opening than that afforded by the house. What would make him talk, she wondered, and what, oh what would he say? Something far, far more romantic than poor Matthew Henson could ever have dreamed of, yes and far, far less romantic, something subconscious prompted her, than Anthony Gross had said. Anthony with his poverty and honour and desperate vows !  They had reached the grove, they had spread the rug and a tablecloth; Roger had covered it with dainties. He would not let her lift a finger, she was the guest and he her humble servant. She looked at him smiling, still forming vague con trasts with him and Matthew and Anthony.  Roger dropped his sandwich, came and sat behind her. He put his arm around her and shifted his shoulder so that her head lay against it.  " Don't look at me that way Angele, Angele ! I can't stand it."  So it was actually coming. " How do you want me to look at you? "        He bent his head down to hers and kissed her. " Like this, like this ! Oh Angele, did you like the house? "  " Like it? I loved it."  " Darling, I had it done for you, you know. I thought you'd like it.  It seemed a strange thing to have done without consulting her, and anyway she did not want to live in a suburb. Opal Street had been suburb enough for her. She wanted, required, the noise and tumult of cities.  " I don't care for suburbs, Roger." How strange for him to talk about a place to live in and never a word of love !  " My dear girl, you don't have to live in a suburb if you don't want to. I've got a place, an apartment in Seventy-second Street, seven rooms; that would be enough for you and your maid, wouldn't it? I could have this furniture moved over there, or if you think it too cottagey, you could have new stuff altogether."  Seven rooms for three people ! Why she wanted a drawing-room and a studio and where would he put his things? This sudden stinginess was quite inexplicable.  " But Roger, seven rooms wouldn't be big enough."  He laughed indulgently, his face radiant with relief and triumph. " So she wants a palace, does she? Well, she shall have it. A whole menage if you want it, a place on Riverside Drive, servants and a car. Only somehow I hadn't thought of you as caring about that kind of thing. After that little hole in the wall you've been living in on Jayne Street I'd have expected you to find          the place in Seventy-second Street as large as you'd care for."  A little hurt, she replied: "But I was think ing of you too. There wouldn't be room for your things. And I thought you'd want to go on living in the style you'd been used to." A sudden wel come explanation dawned on her rising fear. " Are you keeping this a secret from your father? Is that what's the trouble? "  Under his thin, bright skin he flushed. " Keep ing what a secret from my father? What are you talking about, Angele? "  She countered with his own question. " What are you talking about, Roger? "  He tightened his arms about her, his voice stam mered, his eyes were bright and watchful. " I'm asking you to live in my house, to live for me; to be my girl ; to keep a love-nest where I and only I may come." He smiled shamefacedly over the cheap current phrase.  She pushed him away from her; her jaw fallen and slack but her figure taut. Yet under her stunned bewilderment her mind was racing. So this was her castle, her fortress of protection, her refuge. And what answer should she make? Should she strike him across his eager, half-shamed face, should she get up and walk away, forbidding him to follow? Or should she stay and hear it out? Stay and find out what this man was really like; what depths were in him and, she supposed, in other men. But especially in this man with his boy ish, gallant air and his face as guileless and as inno cent apparently as her own.        That was what she hated in herself, she told that self fiercely , shut up with her own thoughts the next afternoon in her room. She hated herself for stay ing and listening. It had given him courage to talk and talk. But what she most hated had been the shrewdness, the practicality which lay beneath that resolve to hear it out. She had thought of those bills ; she had thought of her poverty, of her helplessness, and she had thought too of Martha Burden's dictum: "You must make him want you." Well here was a way to make him want her and to turn that wanting to account. " Don't," Martha said, " withhold too much. Give a little." Suppose she gave him just the encouragement of listening to him, of showing him that she did like him a little; while he meanwhile went on wanting, wanting men paid a big price for their desires. Her price would be marriage. It was a game, she knew, which women played all over the world although it had never occurred to her to play it; a dangerous game at which some women burned their fingers. " Don't give too much," said Martha, " for then you lose yourself." Well, she would give nothing and she would not burn her fingers. Oh, it would be a great game.  Another element entered too. He had wounded her pride and he should salve it. And the only unguent possible would be a proposal of marriage. Oh if only she could be a girl in a book and when he finally did ask her for her hand, she would be able to tell him that she was going to marry some one else, someone twice as eligible, twice as hand some, twice as wealthy.        Through all these racing thoughts penetrated the sound of Roger's voice, pleading, persuasive, seductive. She was amazed to find a certain shamefaced timidity creeping over her;, yet it was he who should have shown the shame. And she could not understand either why she was unable to say plainly: " You say you care for me, long for me so much, why don't you ask me to come to you in the ordinary way? " But some pride either unusually false or unusually fierce prevented her from doing this. Undoubtedly Roger with his wealth, his looks and his family connections had already been much sought after. He knew he was an " eligible ". Poor, unknown, stigmatized, if he but knew it, as a member of the country's least recognized group she could not bring her self to belong even in appearance to that band of young women who so obviously seek a " good match ".  When he had paused a moment for breath she told him sadly: " But, Roger, people don't do that kind of thing, not decent people."  " Angele, you are such a child ! This is exactly the kind of thing people do do. And why not? Why must the world be let in on the relationships of men and women? Some of the sweetest unions in history have been of this kind."  " For others perhaps, but not for me. Relation ships of the kind you describe don't exist among the people I know." She was thinking of her parents, of the Hallowells, of the Hensons whose lives were indeed like open books.  He looked at her curiously, " The people you know! Don't tell me you haven't guessed about Paulette!"          She had forgotten about Paulette ! " Yes I know about her. She told me herself. I like her, she's been a mighty fine friend, but, Roger, you surely don't want me to be like her."  " Of course I don't. It was precisely because you weren't like her that I became interested. You were such a babe in the woods. Anyone could see you'd had no experience with men."  This obvious lack of logic was too bewildering. She looked at him like the child which, in these matters, she really was. " But, but Roger, mightn't that be a beginning of a life like Paul- ette's? What would become of me after we, you and I, had separated? Very often these things last only for a short time, don't they? "  " Not necessarily; certainly not between you and me. And I'd always take care of you, you'd be provided for." He could feel her gathering resentment. In desperation he played a cunning last card: "And besides who knows, something permanent may grow out of this. I'm not entirely my own master, Angele."  Undoubtedly he was referring to his father whom he could not afford to offend. It never occurred to her that he might be lying, for why should he?    To all his arguments, all his half-promises and implications she returned a steady negative. As twilight came on she expressed a desire to go home ; with the sunset her strength failed her; she felt beaten and weary. Her unsettled future, her hurt pride, her sudden set-to with the realities of the society in which she had been moving, bewildered    and frightened her. Resentful, puzzled, intro spective, she had no further words for Roger; it was impossible for him to persuade her to agree or to disagree with his arguments. During the long ride home she was resolutely mute.  Yet on the instant of entering Jayne Street she felt she could not endure spending the long even ing hours by herself and she did not want to be alone with Roger. She communicated this distaste to him. While not dishevelled they were not presentable enough to invade the hotels farther uptown. But, anxious to please her, he told her they could go easily enough to one of the small cabarets in the Village. A few turns and windings and they were before a house in a dark side street knocking on its absurdly barred door, entering its black, myterious portals. In a room with a highly polished floor, a few tables and chairs, some rather bizarre curtains, five or six couples were sitting, among them Paulette, Jack Hudson, a tall, rather big, extremely blonde girl whose name Angela learned was Garlotta Parks, and a slender, black- avised man whose name she failed to catch. Paul ette hailed him uproariously; the blonde girl rose and precipitately threw her arms about Fielding's neck.  "Roger!"  " Don't," he said rather crossly. " Hello, Jack." He nodded to the dark man whom he seemed to know indifferently well. " What have they got to eat here, you fellows? Miss Mory and I are tired and hungry. We've been following the pike all day." Miss Parks turned and gave Angela a long, considering look.  " Sit here," said Paulette, " there's plenty of        room. Jack, you order for them, the same things we've been having. You get good cooking here." She was radiant with happiness and content. Under the influence of the good, stimulating food Angela began to recover, to look around her.  Jack Hudson, a powerfully built bronze figure of a man, beamed on Paulette, saying nothing and in his silence saying everything. The dark man kept his eyes on Carlotta, who was oblivious to everyone but Roger, clearly her friend of long standing. She sat clasping one of his hands, her head almost upon his shoulder. " Roger it's so good to see you again ! I've thought of you so often ! I've been meaning to write to you ; we're having a big house party this summer. You must come ! Dad's asking up half of Washington ; attaches, ( Prinzessen, Counte?sen and serene Eng lish Altessen'; he'll come up for week-ends."  A member of the haut monde, evidently she was well-connected, powerful, even rich. A girl of Roger's own set amusing herself in this curious company. Angela felt her heart contract with a sort of helpless jealousy.  The dark man, despairing of recapturing Car lo tta's attention, suddenly asked Angele if she would care to dance. He was a superb partner and for a moment or two, reinvigorated by the food and the snappy musk, she became absorbed in the smooth, gliding motion and in her partner's pleasant con versation. Glancing over her shoulder she noted Carlotta still talking to Roger. The latter, how ever, was plainly paying the girl no attention. His eyes fixed on Angela, he was moodily following her every motion, almost straining, she thought, to catch her words. His eyes met hers and a long,        long look passed between them so fraught, it seemed to her, with a secret understanding and sympathy, that her heart shook with a moment's secret wavering.  Her partner escorted her back to the table. Paulette, flushed and radiant, with the mien of a dishevelled baby, was holding forth while Hudson listened delightedly. As a raconteuse she had a faint, delicious malice which usually made any recital of her adventures absolutely irresistible. " Her name," she was saying loudly, regardless of possible listeners, " was Antoinette Spewer, and it seems she had it in for me from the very first. She told Sloane Corby she wanted to meet me and he invited both of us to lunch. When we got to the restaurant she was waiting for me in the lobby ; Sloane introduced us and she pulled a lorgnette on me, a lorgnette on me \ " She said it very much as a Westerner might speak of someone " pull ing " a revolver. " But I fixed that. There were three or four people passing near us. I drew back until they were well within hearing range, and then I said to her: ' I beg pardon but what did you say your last name was? ' Well, when a person's named Spewer she can't shout it across a hotel lobby ! Oh, she came climbing down off her high horse; she respects me to this day, I tell you."  Roger rose. " We must be going; I can't let Miss Mory get too tired." He was all attention and courtesy. Miss Parks looked at her again, nar rowing her eyes.  In the car Roger put his arm about her. " An- gele, when you were dancing with that fellow I couldn't stand it ! And then you looked at me,          oh such a look! You were thinking about me, I felt it, I knew it."  Some treacherous barrier gave way within her. " Yes, and I could tell you were thinking about me."  " Of course you could ! And without a word ! Oh, darling, darling, can't you see that's the way it would be? If you'd only take happiness with me there we would be with a secret bond, an invisible bond, existing for us alone and no one else in the world the wiser. But we should know and it would be all the sweeter for that secrecy."  Unwittingly he struck a responsive chord within her, stolen waters were the sweetest, she of all people knew that.  Aloud she said: " Here we are, Roger. Some of the day has been wonderful; thank you for that."  " You can't go like this ! You're going to let me see you again? "  She knew she should have refused him, but again some treacherous impulse made her assent. He drove away, and, turning, she climbed the long, steep flights of stairs, bemused, thrilled, frightened, curious, the sense of adventure strong upon her. To-morrow she would see Jinny, her own sister, her own flesh and blood, one of her own people. To gether they would thresh this thing out.          A CURIOUS period of duelling ensued. Roger was young, rich and idle. Nearly every wish he had ever known had been born within him only to be satisfied. He could not believe that he would fail in the pursuit of this baffling creature who had awakened within him an ardour and sincerity of feeling which surprised himself. The thought occurred to him more than once that it would have been a fine thing if this girl had been endowed with the name and standing and comparative wealth of say Carlotta Parks, but it never occurred to him to thwart in this matter the wishes of his father who would, he knew, insist immediately on a certified account of the pedigree, training and general fitness of any strange aspirant for his son's hand. Angela had had the good sense to be frank ; she did not want to become immeshed in a tissue of lies whose relationship, whose sequence and inter dependence she would be likely to forget. To Roger's few questions she had said quite truly that she was the daughter of " poor but proud parents " ; they had laughed at the hackneyed phrase, that her father had been a boss carpenter and that she had been educated in the ordinary public schools and for a time had been a school teacher. No one would ever try to substantiate these statements, for clearly the person to whom they applied would not          be falsifying such a simple account. There would be no point in so doing. Her little deceits had all been negative, she had merely neglected to say that she had a brown sister and that her father had been black.  Roger found her unfathomable. His was the  careless, unreasoned cynicism of the modern,  worldly young man. He had truly, as he acknow  ledged, been attracted to Angela because of a  certain incurious innocence of hers apparent in her  observations and in her manner. He saw no  reason why he should cherish that innocence. If  questioned he would have answered : " She's got  to learn about the world in which she lives some  time; she might just as well learn of it through me.  And I'd always look out for her." In the back  of his mind, for all his unassuming even simple  attitude toward his wealth and power, lurked the  conviction that that same wealth and power could  heal any wound, atone for any loss. Still there were  times when even he experienced a faint, inner  qualm, when Angela would ask him: " But after  wards, what would become of me, Roger? " It  was the only question he could not meet. Out of all  his hosts of precedents from historical Antony and  Cleopatra down to notorious affinities discovered  through blatant newspaper " stories " he could  find for this only a stammered " There's no need  to worry about an afterwards, Angele, for you and  I would always be friends."  Their frequent meetings now were little more than a trial of strength. Young will and deter mination were pitted against young will and determination. On both the excitement of the chase was strong, but each was pursuing a different  N        quarry. To all his protestations, arguments and demands, Angela returned an insistent: " What you are asking is impossible." Yet she either could not or would not drive him away, and gradually, though she had no intention of yielding to his wishes, her first attitude of shocked horror began to change.  For three months the conflict persisted. Roger interposed the discussion into every talk, on every occasion. Gradually it came to be the raison d'etre of their constant comradeship. His argu ments were varied and specious. " My dearest girl, think of a friendship in which two people would have every claim in the world upon each other and yet no claim. Think of giving all, not because you say to a minister ' I will ', but from the generosity of a powerful affection. That is the very essence of free love. I give you my word that the happiest couples in the world are those who love without visible bonds. Such people are bound by the most durable ties. Theirs is a state of the closest because the freest, most elastic union in the world."  A singularly sweet and curious intimacy was growing up between them. Roger told Angela many anecdotes about his father and about his dead mother, whom he still loved, and for whom he even grieved in a pathetically boyish way. " She was so sweet to me, she loved me so. I'll never forget her. It's for her sake that I try to please my father, though Dad's some pumpkins on his own account." In turn she was falling into the habit of relating to him the little happenings of her every-day life, a life which she was beginning to realize must, in his eyes, mean the last word in          the humdrum and the monotonous. And yet how full of adventure, of promise, even of mystery did it seem compared with Jinny's !  Roger had much intimate knowledge of people and told her many and dangerous secrets. " See how I trust you, Angele; you might trust me a little ! "  If his stories were true, certainly she might just as well trust him a great deal, for all her little world, judging it by the standards by which she was used to measuring people, was tumbling in ruins at her feet. If this were the way people lived then what availed any ideals? The world was made to take pleasure in; one gained nothing by exercising simple virtue, it was after all an extension of the old formula which she had thought out for herself many years ago. Roger spent most of his time with her, it seemed. Anything which she undertook to do delighted him. She would accept no money, no valuable presents. " And I can't keep going out with you to dinners and luncheons forever, Roger. It would be different if, if we really meant anything to each other." He deliberately misunderstood her. " But nothing would give me more pleasure than for us to mean the world to one another." He sent her large hampers of fruit and even the more ordinary edibles; then he would tease her about being selfish. In order to get rid of the food she had asked him to lunch, to dinner, since nothing that she could say would make him desist from sending it.  Nothing gave her greater joy really than this playful housekeeping. She was very lonely; Jinny had her own happy interests; Anthony      never came near her nor did she invite him to come; Martha Burden seemed engrossed in her own affairs, she was undergoing some secret strain that made her appear more remote, more strongly self-sufficient, more mysterious than ever. Paulette, making overt preparations to go to Russia with Hudson, was impossibly, hurtingly happy. Miss Powell, but she could not get near her; the young coloured girl showed her the finest kind of courtesy, but it had about it a remote and frozen quality, unbreakable. However, Angela for the moment did not desire to break it; she must run no more risks with Roger, still she put Miss Powell on the list of those people whom she would some day aid, when everything had turned out all right.  The result of this feeling of loneliness was, of course, to turn her more closely to Roger. He paid her the subtle compliment of appearing abso lutely at home in her little apartment; he grew to like her plain, good cooking and the experi ments which sometimes she made frankly for him. And afterwards as the fall closed in there were long, pleasant evenings before an open fire, or two or three last hours after a brisk spin in the park in the blue car. And gradually she had grown to accept and even inwardly to welcome his caresses. She perched with an air of great unconsciousness on the arm of the big chair in which he was sitting but the transition became constantly easier from the arm of the chair to his knee, to the steely embrace of his arm, to the sound of the hard beat ing of his heart, to his murmured: " This is where you belong, Angele, Angele." He seemed an anchor for her frail, insecure bark of life.        It was at moments like these that he told her amazing things about their few common acquaint ances. There was not much to say about Paulette. " I think," said Roger judicially, " that tempera mentally she is a romantic adventurer. Something in her is constantly seeking a change but she will never be satisfied. She's a good sport, she takes as she gives, asking nothing permanent and promising nothing permanent." Angela thought it rather sad. But Roger dismissed the theme with the rather airy comment that there were women as there were men " like that ". She wondered if he might not be a trifle callous.  More than once they had spoken of Martha Burden; Angela confessed herself tremendously intrigued by the latter, by that tense, brooding personality. She learned that Martha, made of the stuff which dies for causes, was constantly being torn between theory and practice.  " She's full," said Roger, " of the most high- falutin, advanced ideas. Oh I've known old Martha all my life, we were brought up together, it's through her really that I began to know the people in this part of town. She's always been a sort of sister. More than once I've had to yank her by the shoulders out of difficulties which she herself created. I made her marry Starr."  " Made her marry him, didn't she want him? "  " Yes, she wanted him all right, but she doesn't believe in marriage. She's got the courage of her convictions, that girl. Why actually she lived with Starr two years while I was away doing Europe. When I came back and found out what had happened I told Starr I'd beat        him into pulp if he didn't turn around and make good."  " But why the violence? Didn't he want to? "  " Yes, only," he remembered suddenly his own hopes, " not every man is capable of appreciating a woman who breaks through the conventions for him. Some men mistake it for cheapness but others see it for what it is and love more deeply and gratefully." Softly, lingeringly he touched the soft hair shadowing her averted cheek. " I'm one of those others, Angele."  She wanted to say: "But why shouldn't we marry? Why not make me safe as well as Martha? " But again her pride intervened. Instead she remarked that Martha did not seem always happy.  " No, well that's because she's got this fool idea of hers that now that they are bound the spontaneity is lacking. She wants to give without being obliged to give; to take because she chooses and not because she's supposed to. Oh she's as true as steel and the best fighter in a cause, but I've no doubt but that she leads old Starr a life with her temperament."  Angela thought that there were probably two sides to this possibility. A little breathlessly she asked Roger if he knew Anthony Cross.  "Cross, Cross! A sallow, rather thin fellow? I think I saw him once or twice at Paulette's. No, I don't really know him. A sullen, brooding sort of chap I should say. Frightfully self- absorbed and all that."  For some reason a little resentment sprang up in her. Anthony might brood, but his life had been lived on dark, troublesome lines that in-          vited brooding; he had never known the broad, golden highway of Roger's existence. And any way she did not believe, if Martha Burden had been Anthony's lifelong friend, almost his sister, that he would have told his sweetheart or his wife either of those difficult passages in her life. Well, she would have to teach Roger many things. Aloud she spoke of Garlotta Parks.  " She's an interesting type. Tell me about her."  But Roger said rather shortly that there was nothing to tell. "Just a good-hearted, high- spirited kid, that's all, who lets the whole world know her feelings."    According to Paulette there was more than|this to be told about Miss Parks. " i don't 'know her myself, not being a member of that crowd. But I've always heard that she and Roger were child hood sweethearts, only they've just not pulled it off. Carlotta's family is as old as his. Her people have always been statesmen, her father's in the Senate. I don't think they have much money now. But the main thing is she pleases old man Fielding. Nothing would give him more pleasure than to see Garlotta Roger's wife. I may be mistaken, but I think nothing would give Carlotta more pleasure either."  " Doesn't he care for her? " Queer how her heart tightened, listening for the answer.  ;< Yes, but she likes him too much and shows it. So he thinks he doesn't want her. Roger will never want any woman who comes at his first          call. Don't you hate that sort of man? They are really the easiest to catch; all you've got to do provided they're attracted at all, is to give one inviting glance and then keep steadily retreating. And they'll come like Bo Peep's sheep. But I don't want a man like that; he'd cramp my style. His impudence, expecting a woman to re press or evoke her emotions just as he wants them ! Hasn't a woman as much right to feel as a man and to feel first? Never mind, some woman is going to ' get ' Roger yet. He doesn't think it possible because he has wealth and position. He'll be glad to come running to Carlo tta then. I don't care very much for her, she's a little too loud for me," objected the demure and conserva tive Miss Lister, " but I do think she likes Roger for himself and not for what he can give her ! "    Undoubtedly this bit of knowledge lent a new aspect; the adventure began to take on fresh interest. Everything seemed to be playing into her hands. Roger's interest and longing were certainly undiminished. Martha Burden's advice, confirmed by Paulette's disclosure, was bound to bring results. She had only to " keep retreating ".  But there was one enemy with whom she had never thought to reckon, she had never counted on the treachery of the forces of nature ; she had never dreamed of the unaccountable weakening of those forces within. Her weapons were those fur nished by the conventions but her fight was against conditions; impulses, yearnings which antedated both those weapons and the conventions, which        furnished them. Insensibly she began to see in Roger something more than a golden way out of her material difficulties; he was becoming more than a means through which she should be ad mitted to the elect of the world for whom all things are made. Before her eyes he was chang ing to the one individual who was kindest, most thoughtful of her, the one whose presence brought warmth and assurance. Furthermore, his constant attention, flatteries and caresses were pro ducing their inevitable e fleet. She was naturally cold; unlike Paulette, she was a woman who would experience the grand passion only once, perhaps twice, in her life and she would always have to be kindled from without; in the last analysis her purity was a matter not of morals, nor of religion, nor of racial pride ; it was a matter of fastidiousness. Bit by bit Roger had forced his way closer and closer into the affairs of her life, and his proximity had not offended that fastidiousness. Gradually his demands seemed to her to represent a very natural and beautiful im pulse; his arguments and illustrations began to bear fruit; the conventions instead of showing in her eyes as the codified wisdom based on the experiences of countless generations of men and women, seemed to her prudish and unnecessary. Finally her attitude reduced itself to this: she would have none of the relationship which Roger urged so insistently, not because according to all the training which she had ever received, it was unlawful, but because viewed in the light of the great battle which she was wag ing for pleasure, protection and power, it was inexpedient.          The summer and the early fall had passed. A cold, rainy autumn was closing in; the disagree able weather made motoring almost impossible, There were always the theatres and the cabarets, but Roger professed himself as happy nowhere else but at her fireside. And she loved to have him there, tall and strong and beautiful, some times radiant with hope, at others sulking with the assurance of defeat. He came in one day ostensibly to have tea with her; he had an im portant engagement for the evening but he could not let the day pass without seeing her. Angela was tired and a little dispirited. Jinny had sold the house and had sent her twelve hundred dollars as her share, but the original three thousand was almost dissipated. She must not touch this new gift from heaven; her goal was no nearer; the unwelcome possibility of teaching, on the con trary, was constantly before her. Moreover, she was at last realising the danger of this constant proximity, she was appalled by her thoughts and longings. Upon her a great fear was creeping not only of Roger but of herself.  Always watchful, he quickly divined her dis trait mood, resolved to try its possibilities for himself. In a tense silence they drank their tea and sat gazing at the leaping, golden flames. The sullen night closed in. Angela reminded him presently that he must go but on he sat and on. At eight o'clock she reminded him again; he took out his watch and looked at it indifferently. " It's too late for me to keep it now, besides I don't want to go. Angele be kind, don't send me away."  " But you've had no dinner."      " Nor you either. I'm like the beasts of the field keeping you like this. Shall we go out some where? " But she was languid; she did not want to stir from the warm hearth out into the chilly night.  " No, I don't want to go. But you go, Roger. I can find something here in the house for myself, but there's not a thing for you. I hate to be so inhospitable."  " Tell you what, suppose I go around to one of these delicatessens and get something. Too tired to fix up a picnic lunch? "  In half an hour he returned, soaked. " It's raining in torrents! Why I never saw such a night!" He shook himself, spattering rain-drops all over the tiny apartment.  " Roger ! You'll have to take off your coat ! "  He sat in his shirt-sleeves before the fire, his hair curling and damp, his head on his hand. He looked so like a little boy that her heart shook within her. Turning he caught the expression in her eyes, sprang towards her. " Angele you know, you know you like me a little ! "  " I like you a very great deal." He put his arm about her, kissed her; her very bones turned to water. She freed herself, finding an excuse to go into the kitchenette. But he came and stood towering over her in the doorway, his eyes on her every motion. They ate the meal, a good one, almost as silently as they had drunk the tea; a terrible awareness of each other's presence was upon them, the air was charged with passion. Outside the rain and wind beat and screamed.  " It's a terrible night," she said, but he made no reply. She said again, " Roger, it's getting late ?        you must go home." Very reluctantly then, his eyes still on hers, he rose to his feet, got into his overcoat and, hat in hand, stooped to kiss her good-night. His arm stole about her, holding her close against him. She could feel him trembling, she was trembling herself. Another second and the door had closed behind him.  Alone, she sat looking at the fire and thinking: " This is awful. I don't believe anything is going to come of this. I believe I'll send him a note to-morrow and tell him not to come any more."  Someone tapped on the door; astonished that a caller should appear at such an hour, but not afraid, she opened it. It was Roger. He came striding into the room, flinging off his wet coat, and yet almost simultaneously catching her up in his arms. " It's such a terrible night, Angele; you can't send me out in it. Why should I go when the fire is here and you, so warm and soft and sweet ! "  All her strength left her; she could not even struggle, could not speak. He swept her up in his arms, cradling her in them like a baby with her face beneath his own. " You know that we were meant for each other, that we belong to each other!"  A terrible lassitude enveloped her out of which she heard herself panting: " Roger, Roger let me go! Oh, Roger, must it be like this? Can't it be any other way? "  And from a great distance she heard his voice breaking, pleading, promising: " Everything will be all right, darling, darling. I swear it. Only trust me, trust me ! "            Life rushed by on a great, surging tide. She could not tell whether she was utterly happy or utterly miserable. All that she could do was to feel ; feel that she was Roger's totally. Her whole being turned toward him as a flower to the sun. Without him life meant nothing; with him it was everything. For the time being she was nothing but emotion ; he was amazed himself at the depth of feeling which he had aroused in her.  Now for the first time she felt possessive; she found herself deeply interested in Roger's welfare because, she thought, he was hers and she could not endure having a possession whose qualities were unknown. She was not curious about his money nor his business affairs but she thirsted to know how his time away from her was spent, whom he saw, what other places he frequented. Not that she begrudged him a moment away from her side, but she must be able to account for that moment.  Yet if she felt possessive of him her feeling also recognized his complete absorption of her, so com pletely, so exhaustively did his life seem to envelop hers. For a while his wishes, his pleasure were the end and aim of her existence ; she told herself with a slight tendency toward self-mockery that this was the explanation of being, of her being; that men had other aims, other uses but that the sole excuse for being a woman was to be just that, a woman. Forgotten were her ideals about her Art; her ambition to hold a salon; her desire to help other people ; even her intention of marrying in order to secure her future. Only something quite outside herself, something watchful, proud, remote from the passion and rapture which flamed      within her, kept her free and independent. She would not accept money, she would not move to the apartment on Seventy-second Street; she still refused gifts so ornate that they were practically bribes. She made no explanations to Roger, but he knew and she knew too that her surrender was made out of the lavish fullness and generosity of her heart; there was no calculation back of it; if this were free love the freedom was the quality to be stressed rather than the emotion.  Sometimes, in her inchoate, wordless intensity of feeling which she took for happiness, she paused to take stock of that other life, those other lives which once she had known; that life which had been hers when she had first come to New York before she had gone to Cooper Union, in those days when she had patrolled Fourteenth Street and had sauntered through Union Square. And that other life which she knew in Opal Street, aeons ago, almost in another existence. She passed easily over those first few months in New York because even then she had been approaching a threshold, getting ready to enter on a new, undreamed of phase of being. But sometimes at night she lay for hours thinking over her restless, yearning child hood, her fruitless days at the Academy, the abor tive wooing of Matthew Henson. The Hensons, the Hallowells, Hetty Daniels, Jinny ! How far now she was beyond their pale! Before her rose the eager, starved face of Hetty Daniels ; now she herself was cognizant of phases of life for which Hetty longed but so contemned. Angela could imagine the envy back of the tone in which Hetty, had she but known it, would have expressed her disapproval of her former charge's manner of          living. " Mattie Murray's girl, Angela, has gone straight to the bad ; she's living a life of sin with some man in New York." And then the final, blasting indictment. " He's a white man, too. Can you beat that? "          ROGER'S father, it appeared, had been greatly pleased with his son's management of the saw-mills in Georgia; as a result he was making more and more demands on his time. And the younger man half through pride, half through that steady determination never to offend his father, was always ready to do his bidding. Angela liked and appreciated her lover's filial attitude, but even in the period of her warmest interest she resented, secretly despised, this tendency to dependence. He was young, superbly trained; he had the gift of forming friendships whose strength rested on his own personality, yet he distrusted too much his own powers or else he was lazy Angela could never determine which. During this phase of their acquaintanceship she was never sure that she loved him, but she was positive that if at this time he had been willing to fling aside his obsequious deference to his father's money and had said to her: " Angele, if you'll help me, we'll build up a life, a fortune of our own," she would have adored him.  Her strong, independent nature, buffeted and sickened and strengthened by the constant attri tion of colour prejudice, was unable to visualise or to pardon the frame of mind which kept Roger from joining battle with life when the odds were        already so overwhelmingly in his favour. Alone, possessed of a handicap which if guessed at would have been as disabling as a game leg or an atro phied body, she had dared enter the lists. And she was well on the way to winning a victory. It was to cost her, she was beginning to realize, more than she had anticipated. But having entered she was not one to draw back, unless indeed she changed her goal. Hers was a curious mixture of materialism and hedonism, and at this moment the latter quality was uppermost in her life. But she supposed that in some vague future she and Roger would marry. His ardour rendered her com placent.  But she was not conscious of any of these inner conflicts and criticisms; she was too happy. Now she was adopting a curious detachment toward life tempered by a faint cynicism, a detachment which enabled her to say to herself: " Rules are for ordinary people but not for me." She remem bered a verse from a poet, a coloured woman about whom she had often wondered. The lines ran:  "The strong demand, contend, prevail. The beggar is a fool!"  She would never be a beggar. She would ask no further counsel nor advice of anyone. She had been lucky thus far in seeking advice only from Paulette and Martha Burden, two people of markedly independent methods of thought and action. They had never held her back. Now she would no longer consult even them. She would live her life as an individualist, to suit herself without regard for the conventions and established o        ways of life. Her native fastidiousness, she was sure, would keep her from becoming an offence in her own eyes.  In spite of her increasing self-confidence and self-sufficiency Roger's frequent absences left her lonely. Almost then, without any conscious plan ning on her part, she began to work at her art with growing vigour and interest. She was gaining in assurance; her technique showed an increased mastery; above all she had gained in the power to compose, a certain sympathy, a breadth of comprehension, the manifestation of that ability to interpret which she had long sus pected lay within her, lent themselves to her hand. Mr. Paget, the instructor, spoke of her paintings with increased respect; the attention of visitors was directed thereto. Martha Burden and even Paulette, in the intervals of her ecstatic prepara tions, admitted her to the freemasonry of their own assured standing. Anthony Cross reminded her of the possibilities for American students at Fontainebleau. But she only smiled wisely; she would have no need of such study, but she hoped with all her heart that Miss Powell would be the recipient of a prize which would enable her to attend there.  " If she isn't," she promised herself, " I'll make Roger give her her expenses. I'd be willing to take the money from him for that."  To her great surprise her other interest besides her painting lay in visiting Jinny. If anyone had asked her if she were satisfied with her own life, her reply would have been an instant affirmative. But she did not want such a life for her sister. For Virginia there must be no risks, no secrets, no          irregularities. Her efforts to find out how her sister spent her free hours amazed herself; their fruitlessness filled her with a constant irritation which Virginia showed no inclination to allay. The younger girl had passed her examination and had been appointed; she was a successful and enthu siastic teacher; this much Angela knew, but beyond this nothing. She gathered that Virginia spent a good deal of time with a happy, intelligent, rather independent group of young coloured men and women; there was talk occasionally of the theatre, of a dance, of small clubs, of hikes, of classes at Columbia or at New York City College. Angela even met a gay, laughing party, consisting of Virginia and her friends en route to Brooklyn, she had been later informed briefly. The girls were bright birds of paradise, the men, her artist's eye noted, were gay, vital fauns. In the subway beside the laughing, happy groups, white faces showed pale and bloodless, other coloured faces loomed dull and hopeless. Angela began tardily to recognize that her sister had made her way into that curious, limited, yet shifting class of the "best" coloured people; the old Philadelphia phrase came drifting back to her, " people that you know." She was amazed at some of the names which Virginia let drop from her lips in her infrequent and laconic descriptions of certain evenings which she had spent in the home of Van Meier, a great coloured American, a litterateur, a fearless and dauntless apostle of the rights of man ; his name was known, Martha Burden had assured her, on both sides of the water.  Such information she picked up as best she might for Virginia vouchsafed nothing; nor did        she, on the infrequent occasions on which she ran across her sister, even appear to know her. This, Angela pointed out, was silly. " You might just as well speak," she told Jinny petulantly, remem bering uncomfortably the occasion when she her self had cut her sister, an absolute stranger in New York. " Plenty of white and coloured people are getting to know each other and they always acknowledge the acquaintanceship. Why shouldn't we? No harm could come of it." But in Virginia's cool opinion no good could come of it either. Usually the younger girl preserved a discreet silence; whatever resolves she might have made with regard to the rupture between herself and her sister, she was certainly able to keep her own counsel. It was impossible to glean from her per fect, slightly distrait manner any glimpse of her inner life and her intentions. Frequently she showed an intense preoccupation from which she awakened to let fall a remark which revealed to Angela a young girl's normal reactions to the life about her, pleasant, uneventful and tinged with a cool, serene happiness totally different from the hot, heady, turgid rapture which at present was Angela's life.    The Jewish girl, Rachel Salting, who lived on the floor above, took to calling on Angela. " We're young and here by ourselves," she said smiling, " it's stupid for us not to get acquainted, don't you think so? " Hers was a charming smile and a charming manner. Indeed she was a very pretty girl, Angela thought critically. Her skin        was very, very pale, almost pearly, her hair jet black and curling, her eyes large and almond- shaped. Her figure was straight and slender but bore none the less some faint hint of an exotic voluptuousness. Her interests, she informed her new friend, were all with the stage, her ideal being Raquel Meller.  Angela welcomed her friendliness. A strange apathy, an unusual experience for her, had in vaded her being; her painting claimed, it is true, a great deal of time and concentration; her hours with Virginia, while not always satisfactory, were at least absorbing; but for the first time in her knowledge, her whole life was hanging on the words, the moods, the actions of some one else Roger. Without him she was quite lost; not only was she unable to order her days without him in mind, she was even unable to go in quest of new adventures in living as was once her wont. Con sequently she received with outstretched arms anything beyond the ordinary which might break the threatening monotony of her life.  Rachel Salting was like a fresh breeze, a curious mixture of Jewish conservatism and modernity. Hers was a keen, clear mind, well trained in the New York schools and colleges with many branch ing interests. She spoke of psychiatry, housing problems, Zionism, child welfare, with a know ledge and zest which astounded Angela, whose training had been rather superficial and who had begun to adopt Paulette's cleverness and Martha Burden's slightly professional, didactic attitude toward things in general as norms for herself. Rachel, except when dwelling on the Jewish problem, seemed to have no particular views to      set forth. Her discussions, based on her wide reading, were purely academic, she had no desire to proselyte, she was no reformer. She was merely a " nice ", rather jolly, healthy young woman, an onlooker at life which she had to get through with and which she was finding for the moment at any rate, extremely pleasant.  She was very happy; happy like Virginia with a happiness vastly different from what Angela was calling by that name; a breathless, constant, smiling happiness, palpable, transparent, for all the world to see. Within a few weeks after their acquaintanceship had started, Rachel with smiles and blushes revealed her great secret. She was going to be married.  " To the very best man in the world, Angele."  "Yes, I'm sure of it."  " He's very good-looking, tall, "  " As though I didn't know that."  " How could you know? "  " Darling child, haven't I seen him, at least the outline of him, often enough in the hall when I'd come in and turn on that wretched light ? I didn't think you'd ever forgive me for it. It did seem as though I were doing it on purpose."  " Oh, I knew you weren't. Then you have seen him? "  " Yes, he's tall and blond. Quite a nice foil for your darkness. See, I'm always the artist."  "Yes," Rachel said slowly, "he is blond."  Angela thought she detected a faint undertone of worry in her hitherto triumphant voice but decided that that was unlikely.  But Rachel confirmed this impression by her next words: " If only everything will turn out all right."      frfrfrfrfr.frfr.fr.fr.fr.fr PLUM  Angel's rather material mind prompted her to ask: " What's the matter, is he very poor? "  Rachel stared. " Poor? As though that mat tered. Yes, he's poor, but I don't care about that."  " Well, if you don't care about that, what's the trouble then ? He's free, white and twenty-one, isn't he? "  " Yes, yes, it's only oh you wouldn't under stand, you lucky girl ! It's nothing you'd ever have to bother about. You see we've got to get our parents' consent first. We haven't spoken of it yet. When we do, I'm afraid there'll be a row."  Some ritual inherent in her racial connections, Angela decided, and asked no further questions. Indeed, she had small chance, for Rachel, once launched, had begun to expound her gospel of marriage. It was an old, old story. Angela could have closed her eyes and imagined her own mother rhapsodizing over her future with Junius. They would be poor, very poor at first but only at first, and they would not mind poverty a bit. It would be fun together. There were little frame houses in the Bronx that rented comparatively cheap. Perhaps Angela knew of them.  Angela shuddering inwardly, acknowledged that she had seen them, dull brown, high-shouldered affairs, perched perilously on stoops. The rooms would be small, square, ugly,  Rachel would help her John in every way. They would economize. " I won't wash and iron, for that is heart-breaking work, and I want to keep myself dainty and pretty for him, so that when we do become better off he won't have to be ashamed of me. And all the time even in our hardest days      I'll be trying my luck at play- writing." She spoke with the unquenchable ambition which was her racial dowry. "I'll be attending lectures and sitting up in the galleries of theatres where they have the most successful plays. And some day I'll land." Her fanciful imagination carried her years ahead. " On our First Night, Angela, you must be in our box and I'll have an ermine coat. Won't it be wonderful? But nothing will be more wonderful than those first few years when we'll be absolutely dependent on each other; I on what he makes, he on the way I run the home. That will be heaven."  Confidences such as these left Angela unmoved but considerably shaken. There must be some thing in the life of sacrifice, even drudgery which Rachel had depicted. Else why should so many otherwise sensible girls take the risk? But there, it was silly for her to dwell on such pictures and scenes. Such a life would never come to her. It was impossible to conceive of such a life with Roger. Yet there were times in her lonely room when she pondered long and deeply, drawing pictures. The time would be summer; she would be wearing a white dress, would be standing in the doorway of a house in the suburbs very, very near New York. There'd be the best possible dinner on the table. She did love to cook. And a tall, strong figure would be hurrying up the walk: " I had the best luck to-day, Angele, and I brought you a present." And presently after dinner she would take him upstairs to her little work-room and she'd draw aside the curtain and show him a portrait of a well-known society woman. " She's so pleased with it; and she's going to get me lots        of orders, " Somehow she was absolutely sure  that the fanciful figure was not Roger.    Her lover, back from a three weeks' trip to Chicago, dissipated that sureness. He was glad, overwhelmingly glad to be back and to see Angele. He came to her apartment directly from the train, not stopping even to report to his father. " I can see him to-morrow. To-night is absolutely yours. What shall we do, Angele? We can go out to dinner and the theatre or run out to the Country Club or stay here. What do you say? "  " We'll have to stay here, Roger; I'll fix up a gorgeous dinner, better than anything you've had to eat in any of your old hotels. But directly after, I'll have to cut and run because I promised Martha Burden faithfully to go to a lecture with her to night."  " I never knew you to be interested in a lecture before."  She was worried and showed it. " But this is a different sort of lecture. You know how crazy Martha is about race and social movements. Well, Van Meier is to speak to-night and Martha is determined that a lot of her friends shall hear him. I'm to go with her and Ladislas."  " What's to keep me from going? "  " Nothing, only he's coloured, you know."  " Well, I suppose it won't rub off. I've heard of him. They say he really has brains. I've never seen a nigger with any yet; so this bids fair to be interesting. And, anyway, you don't think I'm going to let my girl run off from me the        very moment I come home, do you? Suppose I have Reynolds bring the big car here and we'll take Martha and Ladislas along and anyone else she chooses to brins."  The lecture was held in Harlem in East One Hundred and Thirty-fifth Street. The hall was packed, teeming with suppressed excitement and a certain surcharged atmosphere. Angela radiant, calmed with the nearness and devotion of Roger, looked about her with keen, observing eyes. And again she sensed that fullness, richness, even thick ness of life which she had felt on her first visit to Harlem. The stream of living ran almost molten ; little waves of feeling played out from groups within the audience and beat against her consciousness and against that of her friends, only the latter were without her secret powers of interpretation. The occasion was clearly one of moment. "I'd come any distance to hear Van Meier speak," said a thin-faced dark young man behind them. " He always has something to say and he doesn't talk down to you. To hear him is like reading a classic, clear and beautiful and true."  Angela, revelling in types and marshalling bits of information which she had got from Virginia, was able to divide the groups. There sat the most advanced coloured Americans, beautifully dressed, beautifully trained, whimsical, humorous, bitter, impatiently responsible, yet still responsible. In one section loomed the dark, eager faces of West Indians, the formation of their features so markedly different from that of the ordinary American as to give them a wild, slightly feral aspect. These had come not because they were disciples of Van Meier but because they were earnest seekers after          truth. But unfortunately their earnestness was slightly married by a stubbornness and an un willingness to admit conviction. Three or four coloured Americans, tall, dark, sleek young men sat within earshot, speaking with a curious didactic precision. " They're quoting all the sociologists in the world," Ladislas Starr told his little group in astonishment.  Martha, with her usual thoroughness, knew all about them. They were the editors of a small magazine whose chief bid to fame lay in the articles which they directed monthly against Van Meier; articles written occasionally in a spirit of mean jealousy but usually in an effort to gain a sort of inverted glory by carrying that great name on its pages.  Here and there a sprinkling of white faces showed up plainly, startlingly distinct patterns against a back-ground of patient, softly stolid black faces; faces beaten and fashioned by life into a mold of steady, rock-like endurance, of unshakable, unconquered faith. Angela had seen such faces before in the churches in Philadelphia; they brought back old pictures to her mind.  " There he is ! " exclaimed Martha triumphantly. " That's Van Meier ! Isn't he wonderful? " Angela saw a man, bronze, not very tall but built with a beautiful symmetrical completeness, cross the plat form and sit in the tall, deep chair next to the table of the presiding officer. He sat with a curious immobility, gazing straight before him like a statue of an East Indian idol. And indeed there was about him some strange quality which made one think of the East; a completeness, a superb lack      of self-consciousness, an odd, arresting beauty wrought by the perfection of his fine, straight nose and his broad, scholarly forehead. One look, however casual, gave the beholder the assurance that here indeed was a man, fearless, dauntless, the captain of his fate.  He began to speak on a clear, deep, bell-like note. Angela thought she had never heard its equal for beauty, for resonance, for culture. And ar- the young man had said, he did not talk down. His English was the carefully sifted language of the savant, his periods polished, almost poetical. He was noted on two continents for his sociological and economic contributions, but his subject was racial sacrifice. He urged the deliberate intro duction of beauty and pleasure into the difficult life of the American Negro. These objects should be theirs both as racial heritage and as compensa tion. Yet for a time, for a long time, there would have to be sacrifices, many sacrifices made for the good of the whole. " Our case is unique," the beautiful, cultured voice intoned; " those of us who have forged forward, who have gained the front ranks in money and training, will not, are not able as yet to go our separate ways apart from the unwashed, untutored herd. We must still look back and render service to our less fortu nate, weaker brethren. And the first step toward making this a workable attitude is the acquisition not so much of a racial love as a racial pride. A pride that enables us to find our own beautiful and praiseworthy, an intense chauvinism that is content with its own types, that finds completeness within its own group; that loves its own as the French love their country, because it is their own.          Such a pride can accomplish the impossible." He quoted:  " It is not courage, no, nor hate That lets us do the things we do; It's pride that bids the heart be great, "  He sat down to a surge of applause that shook the building. Dark, drooping faces took on an expression of ecstatic uplift, it was as though they suddenly saw themselves, transformed by racial pride as princes in a strange land in temporary serfdom, princes whose children would know freedom.  Martha Burden and Ladislas went up to speak to him ; they were old friends. Angela, with Roger, visibly impressed, stood on one side and waited. Paulette and Hudson came pushing through the crowd, the former flushed and excited. Little groups of coloured people stood about, some deeply content with a sort of vicarious pride, some arguing; Angela caught sight of Virginia standing with three young men and two girls. They were for the most part gesticulating, lost in a great excitement. But Jinny seemed listless and aloof; her childish face looked thin and more forlornly young than ever. Anthony Cross and a tall man of undeniably Spanish type passed the little party and spoke to one of the men, received introductions. Presently Cross, swinging about, caught sight of Angela and Roger. He bowed hastily, flushing; caught his companion's arm and walked hurriedly from the hall, his head very straight, his slender figure always so upright, so lance y more erect than ever.  Presently Martha's party was all out on the side walk; Roger in fine spirits invited Paulette and          Hudson to ride down town in his car. Paulette was bubbling over with excited admiration of Van Meier. " He isn't a man, he's a god," she proclaimed. " Did you ever see such a superb personality? He's not a magnificent coloured man, he's not ' just as good as a white man ' ; he is a man, just that; colour, race, conditions in his case are pure accidents, he over-rides them all with his ego. Made me feel like a worm too; I gave him my prettiest smile, grand white lady making up to an ' exceptional Negro ' and he simply didn't see me; took my hand, I did my best to make my grasp a clinging one and he passed me right along disengaging himself as cool as a cucumber and making room for a lady of colour." She finished reflectively, " I wonder what he would be like alone."  " None of your nonsense, Paulette," said Roger frowning.  Hudson smiled. " Paulette's a mighty attrac tive little piece, I'll admit, but I'd back Van Meier against her every time; she'd present no temptation to him; the man's not only a prophet and the son of a prophet; he's pride incarnate."  Roger said meditatively, " I wonder what proportion of white blood he has in his veins. Of course that's where he gets his ability."  " You make me tired," said Martha. " Of course he doesn't get it from his white blood; he gets it from all his bloods. It's the mixture that makes him what he is. Otherwise all white people would be gods. It's the mixture and the endur ance which he has learned from being coloured in America and the determination to see life without bitterness, -- "          " Oh help, help," exclaimed Roger. " No more lectures to-night. Look, you're boring Angele to death."  " Nothing of the kind," said Angela, " on the contrary I never was more interested in my life." And reaching back she gave Martha's hand a hearty squeeze.    Sometimes as on that first day at the art class, the five of them, Miss Powell, Paulette, Gross, Martha and Angela met before hours. Miss Powell as always was silent she came solely for her work but the others enjoyed a little preliminary chat. A week or so after the Van Meier lecture all but Paulette were gathered thus on an afternoon when she too came rushing in, starry eyed, flushed, consumed with laughter.  " I've played the biggest joke on myself," she announced, " I've been to see Van Meier."  Martha was instant attention. " A joke on Van Meier? "  " No, on myself, I tell you."  It appeared that she had got Miss Powell to introduce her to one of the clerks in the great leader's office. Paulettte then with deliberate inten tion had asked the girl to lunch and afterwards had returned with her to the office expressing a desire to meet her employer. Van Meier had received her cordially enough but with the warning that he was very busy.  " So I told him that I wouldn't sit down, think ing of course he'd urge me to. But he just raised his eyebrows in the most quizzical way and said, 'Well'?"          " Of course I couldn't let matters rest like that so I sat down and began talking to him, nothing much you know, just telling him how wonderful he was and letting him see that I'd be glad to know him better. You should have seen him looking at me and not saying a word. Presently he reached out his hand and touched a bell and Miss Thing-um-bob came in, your friend, you know, Miss Powell. He looked at her and nodding toward me said: such small potatoes in my life. I tell you he's a personage. Wasn't it great? "  Martha replied crossly that the whole thing seemed to her in dreadfully poor taste, while Miss Powell, after one incredulous stare at the first speaker, applied herself more sedulously to her work. Even Anthony, shocked out of his habitual moroseness pronounced the proceedings " a bit thick, Miss Lister ". Angela conscious of a swell ing pride, stowed the incident away as a tit-bit for Virginia.          LIFE had somehow come to a standstill ; gone was its quality of high adventure and yet with the sense of tameness came no compensating note of assur ance, of permanence. Angela pondered much about this; with her usual instinct for clarity, for a complete understanding of her own emotional life, she took to probing her inner consciousness. The fault, she decided, was bound up in her relationship with Roger. At present in a certain sense she might be said to be living for him; at least his was the figure about which her life resolved, revolved. Yet she no longer had the old, heady desire to feel herself completely his, to claim him as completely hers, neither for his wealth nor for the sense of security which he could afford nor for himself. For some reason he had lost his charm for her, much, she suspected, in the same way in which girls in the position which was hers, often lost their charm for their lovers.  And this realization instead of bringing to her a sense of relief, brought a certain real if some what fantastic shame. If there was to be no permanence in the relationship, if laying aside the question of marriage, it was to lack the dignity, the graciousness of an affair of long standing, of sym pathy, of mutual need, then indeed according to the code of her childhood, according to every p        code of every phase of her development, she had allowed herself to drift into an inexcusably vulgar predicament. Even when her material safety and security were at stake and she had dreamed vaguely of yielding to Roger's entreaties to ensure that safety and security, there might have been some excuse. Life, she considered, came before creed or code or convention. Or if she had loved and there had been no other way she might have argued for this as the supreme experience of her life. But she was no longer conscious of striving for marriage with Roger; and as for love she had known a feeling of gratitude, intense interest, even intense possessiveness for him but she did not believe she had ever known love.  But because of this mingling of shame and re proach she found herself consciously striving to keep their relations on the highest plane possible in the circumstances. She wished now not so much that she had never left Jinny and the security of their common home-life, as that the necessity for it had never arisen. Now suddenly she found herself lonely, she had been in New York nearly three years but not even yet had she struck down deep into the lode of genuine friendship. Paulette was kind and generous; she desired, she said, a close woman friend but Paulette was still the adventuress. She was as likely to change her voca tion and her place of dwelling as she was to change her lover. Martha Burden, at once more stable and more comprehending in the conduct of a friendship once she had elected for it, was, on the other hand, much more conservative in the expenditure of that friendliness; besides she was by her very nature as reserved as Paulette was      expansive, and her native intenseness made it difficult for her to dwell very long on the needs of anyone whose problems did not centre around her own extremely fixed ideas and principles.  As for Anthony Cross, by some curious, utterly inexplicable revulsion of feeling, Angela could not bring herself to dwell long on the possibilities of a friendship with him. Somehow it seemed to her sacrilegious in her present condition to bring the memory of that far-off day in Van Gortlandt Park back to mind. As soon as his image arose she dismissed it, though there were moments when it was impossible for his vision to come before her without its instantly bringing to mind Rachel Salting's notions of love and self-sacrifice. Well, such dreams were not for her, she told herself im patiently. For her own soul's integrity she must make the most of this state in which she now found herself. Either she must effect through it a mar riage whose excuse should be that of safety, assurance and a resulting usefulness; or she must resolve it by patience, steadfastness and affection into a very apotheosis of " free love." Of all possible affaires du coeur this must in semblance at any rate, be the ultimate desideratum, the finest flower of chivalry and devotion.    To this end she began then devoting herself again to the renewal of that sense of possessiveness in Roger and his affairs which had once been so spontaneous within her. But to this Roger pre sented unexpected barriers; he grew restive under such manifestations; he who had once fought so          bitterly against her indifference resented with equal bitterness any showing of possessive interest. He wanted no claims upon him, he acknowledged none. Gradually his absences, which at first were due to the business interests of his father, occurred for other reasons or for none at all. Angela could not grasp this all at once; it was impossible for her to conceive that kindness should create indiffer ence; in spite of confirmatory stories which she had heard, of books which she had read, she could not make herself believe that devotion might sometimes beget ingratitude, loss of appre ciation. For if that were so then a successful relationship between the sexes must depend wholly on the marriage tie without reference to com patibility of taste, training or ideals. This she could scarcely credit. In some way she must be at fault.  No young wife in the first ardour of marriage could have striven more than she to please Roger. She sought by reading and outside questions to inform herself along the lines of Roger's training he was a mining engineer. His fondness for his father prompted her to numerous inquiries about the interest and pursuits of the older Fielding; she made suggestions for Roger's leisure hours. But no matter how disinterested her attitude and tone his response to all this was an increased sullen- ness, remoteness, wariness. Roger was experienced in the wiles of women; such interest could mean only one thing, marriage. Well, Angela might just as well learn that he had no thought, had never had any thought, of marrying her or any other woman so far removed from his father's ideas and requirements.      Still Angela, intent on her ideals, could not comprehend. Things were not going well between them; affairs of this kind were often short-lived, that had been one of her first objections to the arrangement, but she had not dreamed that one withdrew when the other had committed no overt offence. She was as charming, as attractive, as pretty as she had ever been and far, far more kind and thoughtful. She had not changed, how could it be possible that he should be different?  A week had gone by and he had not dropped in to see her. Loneliness settled over her like a pall, frightening her seriously because she was realizing that this time she was not missing Roger so much as that a person for whom she had let slip the ideals engendered by her mother's early teaching, a man for whom she had betrayed and estranged her sister, was passing out of her ken. She had rarely called him on the telephone but suddenly she started to do so. For three days the suave voice of his man, Reynolds, told her that Mr. Fielding was " out, m'm."  " But did you give him my message? Did you ask him to call me as soon as he came in? "  " Yes, m'm."  " And did he? "  " That I couldn't tell you, m'm."  She could not carry on such a conversation with a servant.  On the fifth day Roger appeared. She sprang toward him. " Oh Roger, I'm so glad to see you. Did Reynolds tell you I called? Why have you been so long coming? "  " I'd have been still longer if you hadn't stopped 'phoning. Now see here, Angele, this has got to      stop. I can't have women calling me up all hours of the day, making me ridiculous in the eyes of my servants. I don't like it, it's got to stop. Do you understand me? "  Surprised, bewildered, she could only stammer: " But you call me whenever you feel like it."  " Of course I do, that's different. I'm a man." He added a cruel afterword. " Perhaps you notice that I don't call you up as often as I used."    Her pride was in arms. More than once she thought of writing him a brief note telling him that so far as she was concerned their " affair " was ended. But a great stubbornness possessed her; she was curious to see how this sort of thing could terminate ; she was eager to learn if all the advice which older women pour into the ears of grow ing girls could be as true as it was trite. Was it a fact that the conventions were more important than the fundamental impulses of life, than generosity, kindness, unselfishness? For whatever her original motives, her actual relationship with Fielding had called out the most unselfish qualities in her. And she began to see the conventions, the rules that govern life, in a new light; she realized suddenly that for all their granite-like coldness and precision they also represented fundamental facts; a sort of concentrated compendium of the art of living and therefore as much to be observed and re spected as warm, vital impulses.  Towards Roger she felt no rancour, only an apathy incapable of being dispersed. The conversation          about the telephone left an effect all out of pro portion to its actual importance; it represented for her the apparently unbridgeable difference between the sexes; everything was for men, but even the slightest privilege was to be denied to a woman unless the man chose to grant it. At least there were men who felt like that; not all men, she felt sure, could tolerate such an obviously unjust status. Without intent to punish, with no set purpose in her mind, simply because she was no longer interested, she began to neglect Roger. She no longer let other engagements go for him; she made no attempt to be punctual in keeping such engagements as they had already made; in his presence she was often absorbed, absent- minded, lost in thought. She ceased asking him questions about his affairs.  Long before their quarrel they had accepted an invitation from Martha Burden to a small party. Angela was surprised that Roger should remember the occasion, but clearly he did; he was on hand at the correct date and hour and the two of them fared forth. During the brief journey he was courteous, even politely cordial, but the differ ence between his attitude and that of former days was very apparent. The party was of a more frivolous type than Martha usually sponsored, she was giving it for a young, fun-loving cousin of Ladislas; there was no general conversation, some singing, much dancing, much pairing off in couples. Carlotta Parks was present with Ralph Ashley, the slender, dark man who had appeared with Carlotta when Angela first met her. As soon as Roger appeared Carlotta came rushing toward him.          " I've been waiting for you ! " She dragged at his hand and not unwillingly he suffered himself to be led to a small sofa. They chatted a few minutes; then danced; Roger simply must look at Martha's new etchings. The pair was insepar able for the evening. Try as she might Angela could discover no feeling of jealousy but her dignity was hurt. She could not have received less attention from her former lover if they had never met. At first she thought she would make up to Ashley but something malicious in Car- lotta's glance deterred her. No, she was sick of men and their babyish, faithless ways; she did not care enough about Roger to play a game for him. So she sat quietly in a deep chair, smoking, dipping into the scattered piles of books which lent the apartment its air of cheerful disorder. Occasionally she chatted; Ladislas Starr perched on the arm of her chair and beguiled her with gay tales of his university days in pre-war Vienna.  But she would never endure such an indignity again. On the way home she was silent. Roger glanced at her curiously, raised his eyebrows when she asked him to come in. She began quietly: " Roger I'll never endure again the treatment -- "  But he was ready, even eager for a quarrel. " It looks to me as though you were willing to endure anything. No woman with an ounce of pride would have stood for what you've been standing lately."  She said evenly: "You mean this is the end? We're through?  " Well, what do you think about it? You cer tainly didn't expect it to last for ever."        His tone was unbelievably insulting. Eyeing him speculatively she replied : " No, of course I didn't expect it to last for ever, but I didn't think it would end like this. I don't see yet why it should."  The knowledge of his unpardonable manner lay heavy upon him, drove him to fresh indignity. " I suppose you thought some day I'd kiss your hand and say e You've been very nice to me ; I'll always remember you with affection and grati tude. Good-bye.' "  " Well, why shouldn't you have said that? Cer tainly I'd expected that much sooner than a scene of this sort. I never dreamed of letting myself in for this kind of thing."  Some ugly devil held him in its grasp. " You knew perfectly well what you were letting yourself in for. Any woman would know it."  She could only stare at him, his words echoing in her ears: "You knew perfectly well what you were letting yourself in for."  The phrase had the quality of a cosmic echo; perhaps men had been saying it to women since the beginning of time. Doubtless their biblical equivalent were the last words uttered by Abra ham to Hagar before she fared forth into the wilderness.          LONG after Roger had left her she sat staring into the dark shadows of the room. For a long time the end, she knew, had been imminent; she had been curious to see how it would arrive, but the thought had never crossed her mind that it would come with harsh words and with vulgarity. The departure of Roger himself she shut her hand and opened it meant nothing; she had never loved, never felt for him one-tenth of the devotion which her mother had known for her father, of the spontaneous affection which Virginia had offered Matthew Henson. Even in these latter weeks when she had consciously striven to show him every possible kindness and attention she had done so for the selfish preservation of her ideals. Now she looked back on those first days of delight when his emotions and her own had met at full tide; when she dreamed that she alone of all people in the world was exempt from ordinary law. How, she wondered futilely, could she ever have suffered herself to be persuaded to tamper with the sacred mysteries of life? If she had held in her hand the golden key, love! But to throw aside the fundamental laws of civilization for passion, for the hot-headed wilfulness of youth and to have it end like this, drably, vulgarly, almost in a brawl! How could she endure her-          self ? And Roger and his promises of esteem and golden memories!  For a moment she hated him for his fine words and phrases, hated him for tricking her. No matter what she had said, how she had acted, he should have let her go. Better a wound to her passion than later this terrible gash in her proud assurance, this hurt in the core of herself " God ! " she said, raging in her tiny apartment as a tiger in a menagerie rages in its inadequate cage, " God, isn't there any place where man's re sponsibility to woman begins ? "    But she had grown too much into the habit of deliberately ordering her life, of hewing her own path, of removing the difficulties that beset that path, to let herself be sickened, utterly prostrated by what had befallen her. Roger, her com panion, had gone; she had been caught up in an inexcusably needless affair without the pretext of love. Thank God she had taken nothing from Roger; she had not sold herself, only bestowed that self foolishly, unworthily. However upset and harassed her mind might be it could not dwell too long on this loss of a lover. There were other problems to consider; for Roger's passing meant the vanishing of the last hope of the suc cessful marriage which once she had so greatly craved. And even though she had not actively considered this for some time, yet as a remote possibility it had afforded a sense of security. Now that mirage was dispelled; she was brought with a sudden shock back to reality. No longer was it        enough for her to plan how she could win to a pleasant and happy means of existence, she must be on the gui vive for the maintenance of that very existence itself. New York had literally swallowed her original three thousand dollars; part of Vir ginia's gift was also dissipated. Less than a thou sand dollars stood between her and absolute penury. She could not envisage turning to Jinny; life which had seemed so promising, so golden, had failed to supply her with a single friend to whom she could turn in an hour of extremity.  Such thoughts as these left her panic-stricken, cold with ' fear. The spectre of possible want rilled her dreams, haunted her waking hours, thrust aside the devastating shame of her affair with Roger to replace it with dread and apprehension. In her despair she turned more ardently than ever to her painting; already she was capable of ^doing outstanding work in portraiture, but she lacked cachet; she was absolutely unknown.  This condition of her mind affected her appear ance; she began to husband her clothes, sadly conscious that she could not tell where others would come from. Her face lost its roundness, the white warmness of her skin remained but there were violet shadows under her eyes; her forehead showed faint lines; she was slightly shabby. Gradually the triumphant vividness so characteristic of Angele Mory left her, she was like any one of a thousand other pitiful, frightened girls thronging New York. Miss Powell glanced at her and thought: "she looks unhappy, but how can she be when she has a chance at          everything in the world just because she's white? "  Anthony marked her fading brightness; he would have liked to question her, comfort her, but where this girl was concerned the role of comforter was not for him. Only the instructor, Mr. Paget guessed at her extremity. He had seen too many students not to recognize the signs of poverty, of disaster in love, of despair at the tardy flowering of dexterity that had been mistaken for talent. Once after class he stopped Angela and asked her if she knew of anyone willing to furnish designs for a well-known journal of fashion.  " Not very stimulating work, but the pay is good and the firm reliable. Their last artist was with them eight years. If you know of any one, -- "  She interrupted: " I know of myself. Do you think they'd take me on? "  " I could recommend you. They applied to me, you see. Doubtless they'd take my suggestions into account."  He was very kind; made all the necessary arrangements. The firm received Angela gladly, offering her a fair salary for work that was a trifle narrow, a bit stultifying. But it opened up possi bilities; there were new people to be met; perhaps she would make new friends, form ties which might be lasting.  "Oh/  she said hopefully to herself, "life is wonderful! It's giving me a new deal and I'll begin all over again. I'm young and now I'm sophisticated; the world is wide, somewhere there's happiness and peace and a place for me. I'll find it."          But her hope, her sanguineness, were a little forced, her superb self-confidence perceptibly diminished. The radiance which once had so bathed every moment of her existence was fading gently, inexorably into the " light of common day ".        HOME AGAIN      NEW YORK, it appeared, had two visages. It could offer an aspect radiant with promise or a counten ance lowering and forbidding. With its flattering possibilities it could elevate to the seventh heaven, or lower to the depths of hell with its crushing nega tions. And loneliness ! Loneliness such as that offered by the great, noisy city could never be imagined. To realize it one would have to experience it. Coming home from work Angela used to study the people on the trains, trying to divine what cause had engraved a given expression on their faces, particularly on the faces of young women. She picked out for hersejf four types, the happy, the indifferent, the preoccupied, the lonely. Doubtless her classification was imperfect, but she never failed, she thought, to recognize the signs of loneliness, a vacancy of expression, a listlessness, a faintly pervading despair. She remembered the people in Union Square on whom she had spied so blithely when she had first come to New York. Then she had thought of them as being " down and out ", mere idlers, good for nothing. It had not occurred to her that their chief disaster might be loneliness. Her office was on Twenty-third Street and often at the noon-hour she walked down to the dingy Square and looked again on the sprawling, half-recumbent, dejected figures. And between  Q      them and herself she was able to detect a terrifying relationship. She still carried her note book, made sketches, sitting watching them and jotting down a line now and then when their vacant, staring eyes were not fixed upon her. Once she would not have cared if they had caught her; she would have said with a shrug: " Oh they wouldn't mind, they're too far gone for that." But since then her sympathy and knowledge had waxed. How fiercely she would have rebelled had anyone from a superior social plane taken her for copy !  In the evenings she worked at the idea of a pic ture which she intended for a masterpiece. It was summer and the classes at Cooper Union had been suspended. But she meant to return in the fall, perhaps she would enter the scholarship contest and if successful, go abroad. But the urge to wander was no longer in the ascendant. The prospect of Europe did not seem as alluring now as the prospect of New York had appeared when she lived in Philadelphia. It would be nice to stay put, rooted; to have friends, experiences, memories.    Paulette, triumphant to the last, had left with Hudson for Russia. Martha and Ladislas were spending the summer with Martha's people on Long Island. Roger had dropped into the void, but she could not make herself miss him; to her he was the symbol of all that was most futile in her existence, she could forgive neither him nor herself for their year of madness. If the experience, she          told herself, had ended so-beit everything ends. If it had faded into a golden glow with a wealth of memories, the promise of a friendship, she would have had no qualms; but as matters had turned out it was an offence in her nostrils, a great blot on the escutcheon of her fastidiousness.  She wished that Martha had asked her to spend week-ends with her but the idea had apparently never crossed the latter's mind. " Good-bye until fall," she had said gaily, " do you know, I'm awfully glad to go home this time. I always have my old room; it's like begining life all over again. Of course I wouldn't give up New York but life seems so much more real and durable down there. After all it's where my roots are."  Her roots! Angela echoed the expression to herself on a note that was wholly envious. How marvellous to go back to parents, relatives, friends with whom one had never lost touch ! The peace, the security, the companionableness of it! This was a relationship which she had forfeited with everyone, even with Jinny. And as for her other acquaintances in Philadelphia, Henson, Butler, Kate and Agnes Hallowell, so completely, so casu ally, without even a ripple had she dropped out of their lives that it would have been impossible for her to re-establish their old, easy footing even had she so desired.  Virginia, without making an effort, seemed over whelmed, almost swamped by friendships, pleasant intimacies, a thousand charming interests. She and Sara Penton, another teacher, had taken an apartment together, a three room affair on the top floor of a house on iQth Street, in " Striver's Row ", explained Jinny . Whether or not the nick-          name was deserved, it seemed to Angela well worth an effort to live in this beautiful block with its tree-bordered pavements, its spacious houses, its gracious neighbourliness. A doctor and his wife occupied the first two floors; they were elderly, rather lonely people, for their two children had married and gone to other cities. They had prac tically adopted Virginia and Sara; nursing them when they had colds, indulgently advising them as to their callers. Mrs. Bradley, the doctor's wife, occasionally pressed a dress for them; on stormy days the doctor drove them in his car around to " Public School  " where they both taught. Already the two girls were as full of intimacies, joyous reminiscences, common plans as though they had lived together for years. Secrets, nick names, allusions, filled the atmosphere. Angela grew sick of the phrases: " Of course you don't understand that; just some nonsense and it would take too long to explain it. Besides you wouldn't know any of the people." Even so, unwelcome as the expression was, she did not hear it very often, for Jinny did not encourage her visits to the apart ment even as much as to the boarding house. " Sara will think it strange if you come too often." " We might tell her," Angela rejoined, " and ask her to keep it a secret."  But Jinny opined coolly that that would never do; it was bad to entrust people with one's secrets. " If you can't keep them yourself, why should they? " she asked sagely. Her attitude showed no malice, only the complete acceptance of the stand which her sister had adopted years ago.            In her sequestered rooms in the Village lying in the summer heat unkempt and shorn of its glamour Angela pondered long and often on her present mode of living. Her life, she was pretty sure, could not go on indefinitely as it did now. Even if she herself made no effort it was unlikely that the loneliness could persist. Jinny, she shrewdly sus pected, had known something of this horrible condition when she, the older sister had left her so ruthlessly to go off and play at adventure. This loneliness and her unfortunate affair with Henson had doubtless proved too much for her, and she had deliberately sought change and distraction elsewhere. There were depths upon depths of strength in Jinny and as much purpose and resource as one might require. Now here she was estab lished in New York with friends, occupation, security, leading an utterly open life, no secrets, no subterfuges, no goals to be reached by devious ways.  Jinny had changed her life and been successful. Angela had changed hers and had found pain and unhappiness. Where did the fault lie? Not, cer tainly, in her determination to pass from one race to another. Her native good sense assured her that it would have been silly for her to keep on living as she had in Philadelphia, constantly, through no fault of her own, being placed in impossible positions, eternally being accused and hounded because she had failed to placard herself, forfeiting old friendships, driven fearfully to the establishing of new ones. No, the fault was not there. Perhaps it lay in her attitude toward her friends. Had she been too coldly deliberate in her use of them? Certainly she had planned to utilize      her connection with Roger, but on this point she had no qualms; he had been paid in full for any advantages which she had meant to gain. She had not always been kind to Miss Powell, " but," she murmured to herself, " I was always as kind to her as I dared be in the circumstances and far, far more attentive than any of the others." As for Anthony, Paulette, and Martha, her slate was clear on their score. She was struck at this point to realize that during her stay of nearly three years these five were the only people to whom she could apply the term friends. Of these Roger had dropped out; Miss Powell was negative; Paulette had gone to Russia. There remained only Martha and Anthony. Martha was too intensely interested in the conduct of her own life in connection with Ladislas to make a friend, a satisfying, comfortable, intimate friend such as Sara Penton seemed to be with Virginia. There remained then only Anthony yes, and her new acquaintance, Rachel Salting.    She began then in her loneliness to approach Rachel seeking for nothing other than those almost sisterly intimacies which spring up between solitary women cut off in big cities from their homes and from all the natural resources which add so much to the beauty and graciousness of young woman hood. " If anything comes out of this friendship to advance me in any way," she told herself sol emnly, " it will happen just because it happens but I shall go into this with clean hands and a pure heart merely because I like Rachel."        After the fever and fret of her acquaintanceship with Roger, the slight unwholesomeness attendant on Paulette, the didactic quality lurking in Martha's household, it was charming, even delicious to enter on a friendship with this simple, intelligent, enthusi astic girl. Rachel, for all her native endowment, her wide reading and her broad scholastic contacts, had the straightforward utter sincerity and sim plicity of a child ; at times Angela felt quite sophisti cated, even blase beside her. But in reality they were two children together; Angela's brief episode with Roger had left no trace on her moral nature; she was ashamed now of the affair with a healthy shame at its unworthiness ; but beyond that she suffered from no morbidness. Her sum total of the knowledge of life had been increased ; she saw men with a different eye, was able to differentiate between the attitudes underlying the pleasantries of the half dozen young men in her office ; listening, laughing, weighing all their attentions, accepting none. In truth she had lost to a degree her taste for the current type of flirtations. She might marry some day but all that was still in the dim future. Meanwhile the present beckoned; materi ally she was once more secure, her itching ambition was temporarily lulled; she had a friend. It was just as well to let time slide by for a while.  The two girls spent their evenings together. Rachel's fiance, John Adams, was a travelling sales man and nearly always out of town. When he was home Angela was careful to have an engagement, though Rachel assured her, laughing and sparkling, that the two were already so used to each other that a third person need not feel de trop. Occasionally the three of them went during the hot summer          nights to Coney Island or Far Rockaway. But this jaunt took on the proportions more of an ordeal than a pleasure trip; so packed were the cars \vith helpless humanity, so crowded the beaches, so night marish the trip home. Fortunately Angela came face to face one day with Ralph Ashley, Carlotta's former friend. Low-spirited, lonely, distrait, he asked Angela eagerly to allow him to call occa sionally. He seemed a rather bookish, serious young man who had failed to discover the possi bilities of his inner resources. Without an acquaintance or a book he was helpless. Angela's self-reliance and cleverness seemed to offer a tem porary harbour. Apparently with Carlotta out of town, he was at loose ends. By some tacit understanding he was taken into the little group and as he possessed a car which he was willing and eager to share the arrangement was a very happy one.    These were pleasant days. Long afterwards, Angela, looking back recalled them as among the happiest she had known in New York. In particu lar she liked the hours when she and Rachel were together busied with domestic, homely affairs. They advised each other on the subject of dress; Angela tried out new recipes. In the late even ings she worked on the sketches, recalling them from her note-book while Rachel, sitting sidewise in the big chair, her legs dangling comfortably over its arm, offered comments and suggestions. She had had " courses in art ", and on a trip to France and Italy at the age of eighteen had visited the Louvre, the Pitti and Uffizi Galleries. All this          lent a certain pithiness and authority to the criti cisms which she poured forth for her friend's edifica tion; her remarks rarely produced any effect on Angela, but both girls felt that Rachel's knowledge gave a certain effect of " atmosphere ".  Usually Rachel's talk was on John and their approaching marriage, their unparalleled court ship. Many years later Angela could have related all the details of that simple, almost sylvan wooing, the growing awareness of the two lovers, their mutual fears and hopes, their questionings, assur ances and their blissful engagement. She knew to a penny what John made each week, how much he put by, the amount which thrifty Rachel felt must be in hand before they could marry. Once this recital, so unvarying, so persistent, would have bored her, but she was more sympathetic in these days; sometimes she found herself making sug gestions, saving the house-wifely clippings culled from newspapers, proposing decorations for the interior of one of the ugly little houses on which Rachel had so inexplicably set her heart. She was a little older than her friend, she had had experi ence in keeping house and in shopping with her mother in those far-off days; she ventured occa sionally to advise Rachel in her rare purchases very much as though the latter were her own sister instead of a chance acquaintance whom she had known less than a year.  It was a placid, almost ideal existence. Only one thread of worry ran through its fabric, the thought that Rachel and John would soon be marrying and again Angela would be left on the search for a new friend. With one of them in the Bronx and the other in Greenwich Village, frequent      communication would be physically impossible. But, curiously enough, whenever Angela lamented over this to her friend, a deep sombreness would descend on the latter; she would remark gloomily: " Time enough to worry about that; after all we might not get married. You never can tell." This was too enigmatic for Angela and finally she grew to look on it as a jest, a rather poor one but still a jest.          INTO the midst of this serenity came a bolt from the blue. Rachel, a librarian, was offered the position of head librarian in a far suburb of Brooklyn. Further more a wealthy woman from Butte, Montana, desiring to stay in New York for a few months and taking a fancy to the dinginess of Jayne Street and to the inconveniences of Rachel's apartment found she must live there and not otherwhere. No other location in the whole great city would do; she was willing to sublet at any figure. Unwillingly Rachel named a price which she secretly considered in the nature of highway robbery, but none of this mat tered to Mrs. Denver, who was used to paying for what she wanted. And Rachel could not refuse, for both offers meant a substantial increase in the nest-egg which was to furnish the little brown house in the Bronx. In reality it meant to her extraordinary, unhoped for luck whose only flaw consisted in the enforced separation from her new friend. But to Angela it brought the awfulness of a catastrophe, though not for one moment would she let her deep dismay be suspected. After her first involuntary exclamation of consternation she never faltered in her com plete acquiesence in the plan. But at heart she was sick.      The sudden flitting entailed much work and bustle. Rachel was as untidy as Angela was neat; everything she possessed had to be collected separ ately; there were no stacks of carefully folded clothing to be lifted wholesale and placed in gaping trunks. To begin with the trunks themselves were filled with dubious odds and ends which required to be sorted, given or even thrown away. There was no question of abandoning the debris, for the apartment must be left habitable for Mrs. Denver.  A nightmare then of feverish packing ensued; hasty meals, general house-cleaning. In order to assuage the sinking of her heart Angela plunged into it with great ardour. But at night, weary as she would be from the extra activity of the day, she could not fight off the sick dismay which over flowed her in great, submerging waves. It seemed to her she could not again endure loneliness; she could never summon the strength to seek out new friends, to establish fresh intimacies. She was twenty-six years old and the fact that after having lived all those years she was still solitary appalled her. Perhaps some curse such as one reads of in mediaeval legends had fallen upon her. " Perhaps I'm not meant to have friends," she told herself lying face downwards in her pillows on the sweltering June nights. And a great nostalgia for some thing real and permanent swept upon her; she wished she were either very, very young, safe and contented once more in the protection of her father's household or failing that, very, very old.          A nature as strong, as self-reliant as hers could not remain long submerged ; she had seen too many bad beginnings convert themselves into good endings. One of her most valuable native en dowments lay in her ability to set herself and her difficulties objectively before her own eyes; in this way she had solved more than one problem. On the long ride in the subway back from Brooklyn whither she had accompanied Rachel on the night of the latter's departure she resolved to pursue this course that very night. Mercifully the terrible heat had abated, a little breeze came sifting in her open windows, moving the white sash curtains, even agitating some papers on the table. Soberly she set about the business of getting supper. Once she thought of running up to Rachel's former apartment and proffering some hospitality to Mrs. Denver. Even if the rich new tenant should not accept she'd be pleased doubtless; sooner or later she would be offering a return of courtesies, a new friendship would spring up. Again there would be possibilities. But something in her rebelled against such a procedure; these intimacies based on the sliding foundation of chance sickened her; she would not lend herself to them not ever again. From this day on she'd devote herself to the establishing of permanencies.  Supper over, the dishes cleared away, she sat down and prepared to think. Callers were un likely; indeed there was no one to call, since Ashley was out of town for the week-end, but the pathos of this fact left her untouched. To-night she courted loneliness.  An oft heard remark of her mother's kept running through her mind : " You get so taken up with the          problem of living, with just life itself, that by and by being coloured or not is just one thing more or less that you have to contend with." It had been a long time since she had thought about colour; at one time it had seemed to complicate her life immensely, now it seemed to her that it might be of very little importance. But her thoughts skirted the subject warily for she knew how immensely difficult living could be made by this matter of race. But that should take a secondary place; at present life, a method of living was the main thing, she must get that problem adjusted and first she must see what she wanted. Companionship was her chief demand. No more loneliness, not even if that were the road that led to the fulfilment of vast ambition, to the realization of the loftiest hopes. And for this she was willing to make sacrifices, let go if need be of her cherished independence, lead a double life, move among two sets of acquaint ances.  For deep in her heart she realized the longing to cast in her lot once more with Virginia, her little sister whom she should never have left. Virginia, it is true, showed no particular longing for her; indeed she seemed hardly cognizant of her exist ence; but this attitude might be a forced one. She thought, " I didn't want her, the darling, and so she just made herself put me out of her life." Angela was well aware of the pluck, the indomit- ableness that lay beneath Jinny's babyish exterior, but there was a still deeper stratum of tenderness and love and loyalty which was the real Virginia. To this Angela would make her appeal; she would acknowledge her foolishness, her selfishness; she would bare her heart and crave her sister's forgive-          ness. And then they would live together, Jinny and she and Sara Penton if need be ; what a joke it would all be on Sara ! And once again she would know the bliss and happiness of a home and the stabilities of friendships culled from a certain definite class of people, not friendships resulting from mere chance. There would be blessed Sun day mornings and breakfasts, long walks; lovely evenings in the autumn to be filled with reminis cences drawn from these days of separation. How Virginia would open her eyes at her tales of Paulette and Martha! She would never mention Roger. And as for colour; when it seemed best to be coloured she would be coloured; when it was best to be white she would be that. The main thing was, she would know once more the joys of ordinary living, home, companionship, loyalty, security, the bliss of possessing and being possessed. And to think it was all possible and waiting for her; it was only a matter of a few hours, a few miles.  A great sense of peace, of exaltation descended upon her. Almost she could have said: " I will arise and go unto my father ".    On Sunday accordingly she betook herself to her sister's apartment in isgth Street. Miss Penton, she thought, would be out; she had gathered from the girls' conversation many pointed references to Sara's great fondness, of late, for church, exceeded only by her interest in the choir. This interest in the choir was ardently encouraged by a member of that body who occasionally walked        home with Sara in order more fully to discuss the art of music. Virginia no longer went to church; Sunday had become her " pick-up day ", the one period in the week which she devoted to her cor respondence, her clothes and to such mysterious rites of beautifying and revitalizing as lay back of her healthy, blooming exquisiteness. This would be the first time in many months that the sisters would have been alone together and it was with high hopes that Angela, mounting the brown stone steps and ringing the bell, asked for Virginia.  Her sister was in, but so was Sara, so was a third girl, a Miss Louise Andrews. The room was full of the atmosphere of the lightness, of the badinage, of the laughter which belong to the condition either of youth or of extreme happiness. In the middle of the room stood a large trunk from whose yawning interior Jinny lifted a glowing, smiling face. Angela was almost startled at the bright ecstasy which radiated from it. Sara Penton was engaged rather negligently in folding clothes; Miss Andrews perched in magnificent ease on the daybed, struck an occasional tune from a ukelele and issued commands which nobody heeded.  " Hello," said Virginia carelessly. " Can you get in? I was thinking of writing to you."  " Oh," Angela's hopes fluttered, felt, perished. " You're not going away? " Her heart echoed Jinny's old cry: "And leave me when I'm all ready to come back to you, when I need you so terribly ! "  But of all this Virginia was, of course, unaware. "Nothing different," she said briskly. "I'm going away this very afternoon to Philadelphia,        Merion, points south and west, going to stay with Eda Brown."  Angela was aghast. " I wanted to see you about something rather important, Virginia at least," she added humbly, " important to me." Rather impatiently she glanced at the two girls hoping they would take the hint and leave them, but they had not even heard her, so engrossed were they in dis cussing the relative merits of one- and two-piece sports clothes.  Her sister was kind but not curious. " Unless it's got something to do with your soul's salvation I'm afraid it'll have to wait a bit," she said gaily. " I'm getting a two o'clock train and I must finish this trunk Sara's such a poor packer or I'd leave it for her. As it is she's going to send it after me. Aren't you, darling? " Already Angela's request was forgotten. " After I finish this," the gay voice went on, " I've got some 'phoning to do and oh a million things."  " Let me help you," said Angela suddenly inspired, " then we'll call a taxi and we can go down to the station together and we'll have a long talk so I can explain things."  Virginia was only half-attentive. " Miss Mory wants to go to the station with me," she said throw ing a droll look at her friends. " Shall I take her along? " She vanished into the bedroom, Louise Andrews at her heels, both of them over whelmed with laughter bubbling from some secret spring.  Cut and humiliated, Angela stood silent. Sara Penton who had been looking after the vanishing figures turned and caught her expression. " Don't mind her craziness. She's not responsible to-day."      She came closer. " For heaven's sake don't let on I told you; she's engaged."  This was news. "Engaged? To whom?"  " Oh somebody she's always been crazy about." The inevitable phrase followed: "You wouldn't know who he was."  Not know who he was, not know Matthew! She began to say " Why I knew him before Virginia," but remembering her role, a stupid and silly one now, caught herself, stood expect antly.  " So you see," Sara went on mysteriously, one eye on the bedroom, " you mustn't insist on going to the station with her; he's going to take her down."  " Why, is he here? "  " Came yesterday. We've been threatening all morning to butt in. That's the reason she spoke as she did about your going down. She expressed herself to us, you bet, but she probably wouldn't feel like doing that to you."  " Probably not," said Angela, her heart cold. Her little sister was engaged and she was learning of it from strangers. It was all she could do to hold back the tears. " But you've only yourself to blame," she reminded herself valiantly.  The two girls came back; Virginia still laugh ing but underneath the merriment Angela was able to detect a flurry of nervousness. After all, Jinny was just a child. And she was so happy, it would never do to mar that happiness by the introduction of the slightest gloom or discom fort. Her caller rose to her feet. " I guess^Fll be going."        Virginia made no effort to detain her, but the glance which she turned on her sister was sud denly very sweet and friendly. " Here, I'll run down to the door with you. Sara, be a darling and pick out the best of those stockings for me, put in lots. You know how hard I am on them."  Out in the hall she flung an impulsive arm about her sister. " Oh, Angela, I'm so happy, so happy. I'm going to write you about it right away, you'll be so surprised." Astonishingly she gave the older girl a great hug, kissed her again and again.  " Oh," said Angela, the tears welling from her eyes, " Oh Jinny, you do forgive me, you do, you do? I'm so sorry about it all. I've been wretched for a long time. I thought I had lost you, Virginia."  " I know," said Jinny, " I'm a hard-hearted little wretch." She giggled through her own tears, wiped them away with the back of her childish bronze hand. " I was just putting you through; I knew you'd get sick of Miss Anne's folks and come back to me. Oh Angela, I've wanted you so. But it's all right now. I won't be back for ten weeks, but then we will talk! I've got the most marvellous plans for both of us for all of us." She looked like a wise baby. " You'll get a letter from me in a few days telling you all about it. Angela, I'm so happy, but I must fly. Good-bye, darling."  They clung for a moment in the cool, dim depths of the wide hall.            Angela could have danced in the street. As it was she walked gaily down Seventh Avenue to noth Street and into the bosky reaches of the park. Jinny had forgiven her. Jinny longed for her, needed her; she had known all along that Angela was suffering, had deliberately pun ished her. Well, she was right, everything was right this glorious memorable day. She was to have a sister again, some one of her own, she would know the joy of sharing her little triumphs, her petty woes. Wise Jinny, wonderful Jinny !  And beautiful Jinny, too, she thought. How lovely, how dainty, how fresh and innocent her little sister seemed. This brought her mind to Matthew and his great good fortune. " I'd like to see him again," she mused, smiling mischiev ously. " Doubtless he's forgotten me. It would be great fun to make him remember." Only, of course, now he was Jinny's and she would never get in the way of that darling. " Not even if he were some one I really wanted with all my heart and soul. But I'd never want Matthew." It would be fun, she thought, to see him again. He would make a nice brother, so sturdy and kind and reliable. She must be careful never to pre sume on that old youthful admiration of his. Smiling and happy she reached her house, actually skipped up the steps to her rooms. Her apartment no longer seemed lonely; it was not beautiful and bright like Jinny's but it was snug and dainty. It would be fun to have Virginia and Sara down; yes, and that new girl, that Miss Andrews, too. She didn't care what the other people in the house thought. And the girls themselves, how aston-          ished they would be to learn the true state of affairs ! Suddenly remembering Mrs. Denver, she ran up to see her; that lady, in spite of her wealth and means for self-indulgence, was palpably lonely. Angela cheered her up with mirthful accounts of her own first days in New York; she'd been lonely too, she assured her despondent hostess, sparkling and fascinating.  " I don't see how anybody with a disposition like yours could ever be lonely," said Mrs. Denver enviously. She'd been perilously near tears all day.  Gone, gone was all the awful melancholy, the blueness that had hung about her like a palpable cloud. She was young, fascinating; she was going to be happy, again. Again! She caught her breath at that. Oh, God was good ! This feeling of lightness, of exaltation had been unknown to her so long; not since the days when she had first begun to go about with Roger had she felt so free, bird-like. In the evening Ralph Ashley came with his car and drove her halfway across Long Island, or so it seemed. They stopped at a gorgeous hotel and had a marvellous supper. Ashley was swept off his feet by her gay vitalness. In the doorway of the Jayne Street house she gave him her hand and a bewitching smile. ' You can't imagine how much I've enjoyed myself. I'll always remember it." And she spoke sincerely, for soon this sort of thing would be far behind her.  " You're a witch," said Ashley, his voice shaking a little. " You can have this sort of thing whenever you want it and you know it. Be kind to me, Angele. I'm not a bad fellow."        Frightened, she pushed him away, ran in and slammed the door. No, no, no, her heart pounded. Roger had taught her an unforgettable lesson. Soon she'd be with Jinny and Matthew, safe, sheltered.          IN the middle of the night she found herself sitting up in bed. A moment before she had been asleep, but a sudden thought had pierced her conscious ness so sharply that the effect was that of an icy hand laid suddenly on her shoulder. Jinny and Matthew marry why, that meant why, of course it meant that they would have to live in Phila delphia. How stupid she had been! And she couldn't go back there never, never. Not be cause of the difficulties which she had experienced as a child; she was perfectly willing to cast in her lot again with coloured people in New York. But that was different; there were signal injustices here, too oh, many, many of them but there were also signal opportunities. But Philadelphia with its traditions of liberty and its actual economic and social slavery, its iniquitous school system, its prejudiced theatres, its limited offering of occu pation! A great, searing hatred arose in her for the huge, slumbering leviathan of a city which had hardly moved a muscle in the last fifty years. So hide-bound were its habits that deliberate insult could be offered to coloured people without causing the smallest ripple of condemnation or even consternation in the complacent common wealth. Virginia in one of her expansive moments had told her of a letter received from Agnes      ? ' >  Hallowell, now a graduate of the Women's Medi cal College. Agnes was as fair as Angela, but she had talked frankly, even with pride, of her racial connections. " I had nothing to be ashamed of," Angela could imagine her saying, her cheeks flushing, her black eyes snapping. On her gradua tion she had applied for an interneship at a great hospital for the insane; a position greatly craved by ardent medical graduates because of the un usually large turnover of pathological cases. But the man in charge of such appointments, looking Agnes hard in the eye told her suavely that such a position would never be given to her " not if you passed ahead of a thousand white candidates." As for Angela, here was the old problem of possible loneliness back on her hands. Virginia, it was true, would hardly marry at once, perhaps they would have a few happy months together. But afterwards. . . . She lay there, wide awake now, very still, very straight in her narrow bed, watching the thick blackness grow thinner, less opaque. And suddenly as on a former occasion, she thought of marriage. Well, why not? She had thought of it once before as a source of relief from poverty, as a final barrier between herself and the wolves of prejudice; why not now as a means of avoiding loneliness? " I must look around me," her thoughts sped on, and she blushed and smiled in the darkness at the cold-bloodedness of such an idea. But, after all, that was what men said and did. How often had she heard the expression " he's ready to settle down, so he's looking around for a wife ". If that were the procedure of men it should certainly be much more so the procedure of women since their fate was so      much more deeply involved. The room was growing lighter; she could see the pictures a deeper blur against the faint blur of the walL Her passing shame suddenly spent itself, for, after all, she knew practically no men. There was Ashley but she was through with men of his type. The men in her office were nearly all impos sible, but there were three, she told herself, coldly, unenthusiastic, who were not such terrible pills.  " But no," she said out loud. " I'd rather stay single and lonely, too, all my life than worry along with one of them. There must be someone else." And at once she thought of Anthony Cross. Of course there was Anthony. " I believe I've always had him in the back of my mind," she spoke again to the glimmering greyness. And turning on her pillow she fell, smiling, asleep.    Monday was a busy day; copy must be pre pared for the engraver; proofs of the current edition of the magazine had to be checked up; some important French fashion plates for which she was responsible had temporarily disappeared and must be unearthed. At four- thirty she was free to take tea with Mrs. Denver, who imme diately thereafter bore her off to a " movie " and dinner. Not until nine o'clock was she able to pursue her new train of thought. And even when she was at liberty to indulge in her habit of intro spection she found herself experiencing a certain reluctance, an unexpected shyness. Time was needed to brood on this secret with its promise of happiness; this means of salvation from the          problems of loneliness and weakness which beset her. For since the departure of Roger she fre quently felt herself less assured; it would be a relief to have some one on whom to lean; some one who would be glad to shield and advise her, and love her ! This last thought seemed to her marvellous. She said to herself again and again : " Anthony loves me, I know it. Think of it, he loves me ! " Her face and neck were covered with blushes; she was like a young girl on the eve of falling in love, and indeed she herself was entering on that experience for the first time. From the very beginning she had liked Anthony, liked him as she had never liked Roger for himself, for his sincerity, for his fierce pride, for his poverty, for his honest, frantic love. " And now," she said solemnly, " I believe I'm going to love him; I believe I love him already."  There were many things to be considered. His poverty, but she no longer cared about that; in sensibly her association with Rachel Salting, her knowledge of Rachel's plans and her high flouting of poverty had worked their influence. It would be fun, fun to begin at the beginning, to save and scrape and mend. Like Rachel she would do no washing and ironing, she would keep herself dainty and unworn, but everything else, every thing else she would do. Cook and she could cook; she had her blessed mother to thank for that. For a moment she was home again on Opal Street, getting Monday dinner, laughing with Virginia about Mrs. Henrietta Jones. There they were at the table, her pretty mother, her father with his fine, black face his black face, she had forgotten that.      Colour, here the old problem came up again. Restlessly she paced the room, a smouldering cigar ette in her fingers. She rarely smoked but some times the insensate little cylinder gave her a sense of companionship. Colour, colour, she had for gotten it. Now what should she do, tell Anthony? He was Spanish, she remembered, or no, since he came from Brazil he was probably Portuguese, a member of a race devoid, notoriously devoid of prejudice against black blood. But Anthony had lived in America long enough to become inocu lated; had he ever spoken about coloured people, had the subject ever come up? Wait a minute, there was Miss Powell; she remembered now that his conduct towards the young coloured woman had always been conspicuously correct; he had placed chairs for her, opened doors, set up easels; once the three of them had walked out of Cooper Union together and Anthony had carefully helped Miss Powell on a car, removing his hat with that slightly foreign gesture which she admired so much. And so far as she knew he had never used any of Roger's cruelly slighting ex pressions; the terms "coon", "nigger", "darky" had never crossed his lips. Clearly he had no conscious feeling against her people " my people " she repeated, smiling, and wondered herself which people she meant, for she belonged to two races, and to one far more conspicuously than the other. Why, Anthony had even attended the Van Meier lecture. And she wondered what Van Meier would say if she presented her problem to him. He had no brief, she knew, against intermarriage, though, because of the high social forfeit levied, he did not advocate its practice in America.      For a moment she considered going to him and asking his advice. But she was afraid that he would speak to her about racial pride and she did not want to think of that. Life, life was what she was struggling for, the right to live and be happy. And once more her mother's dictum flashed into her mind. " Life is more important than colour." This, she told herself, was an omen, her mother was watching over her, guiding her. And, burying her face in her hands, she fell on her knees and wept and prayed.    Virginia sent a gay missive: " As soon as you left that wretch of a Sara told me that she had let you in on the great news. I wish I'd known it, I'd have spoken to you about it there in the hall; only there was so much to explain. But now you know the main facts, and I can wait until I see you to tell you the rest. But isn't it all wonderful? Angela, I do believe I'm almost the happiest girl alive !  " It's too lovely here. Edna is very kind and you know I always did like Pennsylvania country. Matthew is out almost every day. He tells me it renews his youth to come and talk about old times, anyone to hear us reminiscing, starting every  other sentence with ' do you remember ? '  would think that we averaged at least ninety years apiece. It won't pique your vanity, will it, if I tell you that he seems to have recovered entirely from his old crush on you? Maybe he was just in love with the family and didn't know it.        " We go into Philadelphia every day or two. The city has changed amazingly. But after the hit or miss method of New York society there is something very restful and safe about this tight organization of time I've been here I've met loads of first families, people whose names we only knew when we were children. But they all seem to remember father and mother; they all begin: ' My dear, I remem ber when Junius Murray ' I meet all these  people, old and young, through Matthew, who seems to have become quite the beau here and goes everywhere. He really is different. Even his hair in some mysterious way is changed. Not that I ever minded; only he's so awfully nice that I just would like all the nice things of the world added unto him. We were talking the other day about the wedding, and I was thinking what a really distinguished appearance he would make. Dear old Matt, I'm glad I put off marriage until he could cut a fine figure. Write me, darling, if you feel like it, but don't expect to hear much from me. I'm so happy I can't keep still long enough to write. The minute I get back to New York though we'll have such a talk as never    Mrs. Denver was growing happier; New York was redeeming itself and revealing all the riches which she had suspected lay hidden in its ware houses. Through one letter of introduction forced into her unwilling hands by an officious acquaint ance on her departure from Butte she had gained an entree into that kindest and happiest of        New York's varied groups, the band of writers, columnists, publishers and critics. The lady from the middle West had no literary pretensions her self, but she liked people who had them and lived up to them; she kept abreast of literary gossip, read Vanity Fair, the New Yorker, and Mercury. As she was fairly young, dainty, wealthy and generous and no grinder of axes, she was caught up and whirled right along into the glaxy of teas, luncheons, theatre parties and " barbecues " which formed the relaxations of this joyous crowd. Soon she was overwhelmed, with more invitations than she could accept; to those which she did consider she always couched her acceptance in the same terms. " Yes I'll come if I may bring my young friend, Angele Mory, along with me. She's a painter whom you'll all be glad to know some day." Angela's chance kindness to her in her days of loneliness and boredom had not fallen on barren ground.  Now indeed Angela was far removed from the atmosphere which she had known in Greenwich Village; the slight bohemianism which she had there encountered was here replaced by a somewhat bourgeois but satisfying sophistication. These people saw the " Village " for what it was, a network of badly laid off streets with, for the most part, uncomfortable, not to say inconvenient dwellings inhabited by a handful of artists in the midst of a thousand poseurs. Her new friends were frankly interested in the goods of this world. They found money an imperative, the pre-eminent, concomitant of life; once obtained, they spent it on fine apartments, beautiful raiment, delicate viands, and trips to Paris and Vienna. Conver-      >  sation with them was something more than an exchange of words; "quips and jests" passed among them, and, though flavoured with allusions to stage and book, so that Angela was at times hard put to it to follow the trend of the talk, she half suspected that she was in this company assist ing more nearly at the restoration of a lost art than in any other circles in the world save in the corres ponding society of London.  Once again her free hours could be rilled to overflowing with attention, with gaiety, with intel lectual excitement; it came to her one day that this was the atmosphere of which she once had dreamed. But she was not quite happy, her economic condi tion interfered here. Constantly she was receiving every conceivable manifestation of an uncalculat- ing generosity at the hands not only of Mrs. Denver but of her new acquaintances. And she could make no adequate return ; her little apartment had turned too shabby for her to have guests of this calibre, even in to tea. Her rich friend, making short shrift of such furniture as Rachel Salting had left behind, had transformed her dwelling into a marvel of luxury and elegance; tiny but beautiful. Mrs. Denver was the soul of real and delicate kindness but Angela could not accept favours indefinitely; besides she was afraid to become too used to this constant tide from a horn of plenty on which she had absolutely no claim. If there were any one thing which the harsh experiences of these last three years had taught her it was the impermanence of relationships ; she must, she felt, lay down and follow a method of living for herself which could never betray her when the attention of the rich and great should be withdrawn. Gradu-        ally she ceased accepting Mrs. Denver's invitations; she pleaded the necessity of outside work along the lines of her employment ; she was busy, too, on the portrait of her mother, stimulating her vivid memory with an old faded photograph. Her inten tion was to have it as a surprise for Virginia upon the latter's return.  But before withdrawing completely she made the acquaintance of a young married woman and her husband, a couple so gifted, so genuine and sincere that she was unable to keep to the letter her spartan promise of cutting herself entirely adrift from this fascinating cross-section of New York society. The husband, Walter Sandburg, was a playwright; his name was a household word ; the title of one or another of his dramas glittered on Broadway every night. His wife, Elizabeth, reviewed books for one of the great New York weeklies. Their charm ing apartment in Fifty-fifth Street was the centre for many clever and captivating people. Between these two and Angela something of a real friendship awakened; she was not ashamed to have them see the shabbiness of her apartment. The luncheons to which she treated Elizabeth in the Village tea rooms and in apartment stores brought as great satisfaction as the more elaborate meals at the Algonquin, the favourite rendezvous of many of these busy, happy, contented workers.  Ashley, too, had returned to a town still devoid of Carlotta, and in his loneliness was again con stantly seeking Angela. His attitude was perfect; never by word or look did he revive the unpleasant impression which he had once made; indeed, in a sober, disillusioned sort of way, she was growing to like him very much. He was shy, sensitive,          sympathetic and miserably lonely. It was not likely that his possessions were as fabulously great as Roger's but it was certain that he belonged to Roger's social group with all that such a ranking implies. But in spite of this he was curiously diffident; lacking in pep, the girls in his " set " coldly classified him, and let him alone. Outside his group ambitious Amazons daubed him " easy " and made a mad rush for him and his fabled millions. The two verdicts left him ashamed and frightened; annually he withdrew farther and farther into his shell, emerging only in response to Carlotta's careless and occasional beckoning or to Angela's genuine and pre-occupied indifference. But this was not her world; for years she had craved such a milieu, only to find herself, when once launched into it, outwardly perfectly at ease, inwardly perturbed and dismayed. Although she rarely thought of colour still she was conscious of living in an atmosphere of falseness, of tangled implications. She spoke often of Martha Burden and her husband; Walter Sandburg the play wright, knew Ladislas Starr; Elizabeth had met Paulette Lister in some field of newspaper activity, and Ashley of course had seen Roger in Angela's company. Behind these three or four names and the background which familiarity with them implied, she did not dare venture and in her gayest moments she was aware of the constant stirring within of a longing for someone real and per manent with whom she could share her life. She would, of course make up with Jinny, but Jinny was going to live in Philadelphia, where she herself would never sojourn again. That aftermath was the real consideration.  s      Her thoughts went constantly winging to Anthony; her determination became static. Sav ing only this invisible mixture of dark blood in her veins they, too, could meet on a par. They were both young, both gifted, ambitious, blessedly poor. Together they would climb to happier, sunnier heights. To be poor with Anthony; to struggle with him; to help him keep his secret vow; to win his surprised and generous approba tion ; finally to reach the point where she, too, could open her home to poor, unknown, struggling geniuses, life could hold nothing more pleasing than these possibilities. And how kind she would be to these strangers ! How much she hoped that among them there would be some girl struggling past the limitations of her heritage even as she her self had done. Through some secret, subtle bond of sympathy she would, she was sure, be able to recognize such a girl; and how she would help her and spur her on ! To her communings she said humbly, " I am sure that this course will work out all right for me for see, I am planning chiefly for Anthony and for helpless, harassed people; hardly anything for myself but protection and love. I am willing to work for success and happiness." And even as she spoke she knew that the summit of her bliss would be reached in the days while she and Anthony were still poor and struggling and when she would be giving of her best to make things so.  Elizabeth Sandburg reminiscing about the early married days of herself and Walter gave a fillip to her thought. Said Elizabeth: " Walt and I were just as poor as we could be, we only made twenty dollars a week, and half of that went for a room in          a cheap hotel. Meals even at the punkest places were awfully expensive, and half the time I used to cook things over the gas-jet. I didn't know much about cooking, and I imagine the stuff was atrocious, but we didn't mind. There were we with no one to interfere with us ; we had each other and we didn't give a damn."  Smiling, glowing, she gave Angela a com mission to paint hers and her Walter's portraits. " We'll leave the price to you and if you really put the job over I'll get you a lot of other sitters. No, don't thank me. What are friends for? That's what I always say."          SOMETIMES this thought confronted her: " Per haps Anthony no longer needs me; has forgotten me." And at the bare idea her heart would con tract with an actual, palpable movement. For by now he was representing not only surcease from loneliness but peace and security ; a place not merely in society but in the world at large. Marriage appeared, too, in a different light. Until she had met Roger she had not thought much about the institution except as an adventure in romance or as a means to an end; in her case the method of achieving the kind of existence which once had been her ideal. But now she saw it as an end in itself; for women certainly; the only, the most desirable and natural end. From this state a gifted, an ambitious woman might reach forth and acquit herself well in any activity. But marriage must be there first, the foundation, the substratum. Of course there were undoubtedly women who, like men, took love and marriage as the sauce of exist ence and their intellectual interests as the main dish. Witness for instance, Paulette. Now that she came to think of it, Paulette might vary her lovers but she never varied in the manifestation of her restless, clever mental energy. At no time did she allow her " love-life ", as the psycho-analyst termed it, to interfere with her mental interests,      Indeed she made no scruple of furthering these same interests by her unusual and pervasive sex charm. But this was Paulette, a remarkable per sonage, a woman apart. But for most women there must be the safety, the assurance of relation ship that marriage affords. Indeed, most women must be able to say as did men, " You are mine," not merely, " I am yours."  A certain scorching humility thrust itself upon her. In all her manifestations of human relation ships, how selfish she had been ! She had left Virginia, she had taken up with Roger to further her own interests. For a brief interval she had perhaps loved Roger with the tumultuous, heady passion of hot, untried youth. But again when, this subsiding, she had tried to introduce a note of idealism, it had been with the thought of saving her own soul. She thought of her day in the park with Anthony, his uncomplaining acceptance of her verdict; his wistfully grateful: "I almost touched happiness ". How easily she might have made him happy if she had turned her thoughts to his needs. But she had never thought of that; she had been too intent always on happiness for herself. Her father, her mother and Jinny had always given and she had always taken. Why was that? Jinny had sighed: "Perhaps you have more white blood than Negro in your veins." Perhaps this selfishness was what the possession of white blood meant; the ultimate definition of Nordic Supremacy.  Then she remembered that Anthony was white and, bewildered ; she ceased trying to cogitate, to unravel, decipher, evaluate. She was lonely, she loved. She meant to find a companion ; she meant to be beloved.          She must act.  None of her new friends was acquainted with Anthony. Ralph Ashley in response to a tentative question could not recall ever having seen him. The time was August, consequently he could not be at the school. Telephone books revealed nothing. " Lost in a great city ! " she told herself and smiled at the cheap novel flavour of the phrase. She sent her thoughts fluttering back to the last time she had really seen Anthony, to their last intimate conversation. They had met that day after she had cut Jinny; she remembered, smiling now in her superior knowledge, the slight panic which she had experienced at his finding her in a 'bus in Harlem. There had been some chaffing about tea and he had given her his address and she had put it, where? It was not in her address book. A feverish search through her little desk revealed it in the pages of her prayer book, the one which she had used as a child. This she considered a good omen. The bit of paper was crinkled and blurred but she was able to make out an address on One Hundred and Fourteenth Street. Suppose he were no longer there ! She could not brook the thought of another night of uncertainty; it was ten o'clock but she mounted a 'bus, rode up to One Hundred and Fourteenth and Seventh Avenue. Her heart beat so loudly as she turned the corner, it seemed as though the inhabitants of the rather shabby block hearing that human dynamo would throng their windows. The street, like many others in New York, possessed the pseudo elegance and impressiveness which comes from an equip ment of brown stone houses with their massive fronts, their ostentatious regularity and simplicity,        but a second glance revealed its down-at-heel condition; gaping windows disclosed the pitiful smallness of the rooms that crouched behind the pretentious outsides. There was something faintly humorous, ironical, about being cooped up in these deceptive palaces; according to one's tem perament one might laugh or weep at the thought of how these structures, the product of human energy could yet cramp, imprison, even ruin the very activity which had created them.  Angela found her number, mounted the steps, sought in the dim, square hall feverishly among the names in the bells. Sullivan, Brown, Hend- rickson, Sanchez, and underneath the name of Sanchez on the same card, five small, neat char acters in Anthony's inimitably clear printing Cross. She almost fainted with the relief of it. Her fingers stole to the bell, perhaps her one time fellow-student was up in his room now, how strange that this bit of gutta percha and its attendant wires should bridge all the extent of time and space that had so long lain between them! But she could not push it; Anthony, she was sure, was real enough, close enough to the heart of living to refuse to be shocked by any mere breach of the conventionalities. Even so, however, to seek at eleven o'clock at night and without pre liminary warning admission to the rooms of a man whom one has not noticed for a year, was, as he himself would have put it, " a bit thick ".  The little note which she sent was a model of demureness and propriety. " Dear Anthony," it read, " Do you remember my promising to ask you in for tea the next time I made a batch of          cookies? Well, to-morrow at . will be the next time. Do come ! "  He had changed ; her interested, searching eyes descried it in a moment. Always grave, always austere, always responsible, there was now in his manner an imponderable yet perceptible increment of each quality. But this was not all; his old familiar tortured look had left him; a peace, a quality of poise hovered about him, the composure which is achieved either by the attainment or by the relinquishment of the heart's desire. There is really very little difference, since each implies the cessation of effort.  All this passed rapidly through Angela's mind. Aloud she said : " How do, Anthony? you're really looking awfully well. It's nice to see you again."  " It's nice to see you," he replied. Certainly there was nothing remarkable about their con versation. After the bantering, the jests and allusions which she had been used to hearing at the Sandburgs, compared with the snappy jargon of Mrs. Denver's "crowd" this was trivial, not to say banal. She burst out laughing. Anthony raised his eyebrows.  " What's so funny? Is it a secret joke? "  " No, only I've been thinking hard about you for a long time." She made a daring stroke. " Presumably you've thought occasionally about me. Yet when we meet we sit up like a dandy and a dowager with white kid gloves on and exchange comments on our appearances. I sup pose the next step in order would be to talk about the weather. Have you had much rain up in One Hundred and Fourteenth Street, Mr Gross? "          Some of his poise forsook him. The pervasive peacefulness that sat so palpably upon him deserted him like a rended veil. " You've been thinking about me for a long time? Just how long? "  " I couldn't tell you when it began." She ven tured another bold stroke. " But you've been in the back of my mind, oh for ages, ages."  The poise, the composure, the peace were all fled now. Hastily, recklessly he set down his glass of tea, came and towered over her. She bit her lips to hide their trembling. Oh he was dear, dearer than she had ever imagined, so transparent, so honest. Who was she to deserve him?  His face quivered. He should never have come near this girl ! As suddenly as he had left his chair he returned to it, settled himself com fortably and picked up his glass. " I've been away from you so long I had forgotten."  " Forgotten what? "  " Forgotten how dangerous you are. For gotten how a woman like you plays with poor fools like me. Why did you send for me? To set me dancing once more to your tune? "  His bitterness surprised and frightened her. " Anthony, Anthony don't talk like that ! I sent for you because I wanted to see you, wanted to talk to my old friend."  Appeased, he lounged back in the famous and unique easy chair, lit a cigarette. She brought out some of her sketches, displayed her note-book. He was especially interested in the " Fourteenth Street Types ", was pleased with the portrait of her mother. " She doesn't look like you, though I can see you probably have her hair and that pearly tint of her skin. But you must have got      your nose from your father. You know all the rest of your face," he dwelt on her features dreamily, " your lips, your eyes, your curly lashes are so deliciously feminine. But that straight nose of yours betokens strength." The faded, yet striking photograph lay within reach. He picked it up, studying it thoughtfully. " What a beautiful woman; all woman I should say. Did she have much effect on your life? "  " N-no, I can't say she did." She remembered those Saturday excursions and their adventures in " passing ", so harmless, yet so far-reaching. " Oh yes, in one respect she influenced me greatly, changed my whole life."  He nodded, gazing moodily at the picture. " My mother certainly affected me."  Angela started to say glibly; " She made you what you are to-day"; but a glance at his brooding countenance made her think better of it.  " What's this? " He had turned again to the sketch book and was poring upon a mass of lightly indicated figures passing apparently in review before the tall, cloaked form of a woman, thin to emaciation, her hands on her bony hips, slightly bent forward, laughing uproariously yet with a certain chilling malevolence. " I can't make it out."  With something shamefaced in her manner she took it from him. "I'm not sure yet whether I'll develop it. I, it's an idea that has slowly taken possession of me since I've been in New York. The tall woman is Life and the idea is that she laughs at us; laughs at the poor people who fall into the traps which she sets for us."          Sorrow set its seal on his face as perceptibly as though it had been stamped there. He came closer. " You've found that out too? If I could have managed it you would never have known it. I wanted so to keep it from you." His manner suddenly changed. " I must go. This afternoon has been perfect; I can't thank you enough, but I'm not coming again."  " Not coming again ! What nonsense ! Why, why ever not? Now, Anthony, don't begin that vow business. To-day has been perfect, marvel lous. You don't suppose I'm going to let my friend go when I'm really just discovering him ! "  Weakly he murmured that it was foolish for them to take up each other's time; he was going away.  " All the more reason, then, why we should be seeing each other."  His glance fell on the formless sketch. " If I could only get one laugh on life. . . . When are you going to let me see you again? I'm my own man just now; my time is at your disposal."  The next afternoon they met outside her office building and dined together. On Friday they sailed to the Atlantic Highlands. Saturday, Sun day, Monday, Tuesday flashed by, meaning nothing to either except for the few hours which they spent in each other's company. Thursday was a slack day; she arranged her work so as to be free for the afternoon, and they passed the hurrying, glamorous hours in Van Cortlandt Park, laughing, jesting, relating old dreams, relapsing into silences more intimate than talk, blissfully aware of each other's presence, still more throbbingly aware of a con versation held in this very Park years ago Back          again in the little hall on Jayne Street he took her in his arms and kissed her slowly, with rapture, with adoration and she returned his kisses. For a long time he held her close against his pounding heart; she opened her languid eyes to meet his burning gaze which she could feel rather than see. Slowly he took her arms from his neck, let them drop.  " Angel, Angel, I shall love you always. Life cannot rob me of that. Good-bye, my sweetest."  He was lost in the shadowy night.  The next day passed and the next. A week sped. Absolute silence. No sign of him by either word or line.    At the end of ten days, on a never to be forgotten Sunday afternoon, she went to see him. Without conscious volition on her part she was one moment in her apartment on Jayne Street; and at the end of an hour she was pressing a button above the name Cross in a hall on One Hundred and Four teenth Street, hearing the door click, mounting the black well of a stair-way, tapping on a door bearing the legend " Studio ".  A listless voice said " Come in."  Presently the rather tall, slender young man sitting in his shirt sleeves, his back toward her, staring dejectedly but earnestly at a picture on the table before him asked: " What can I do for you? "  The long and narrow room boasted a rather good parquet floor and a clean plain wall paper covered with unframed pictures and sketches. In one corner stood an easel; the furniture for the          most part was plain but serviceable and com fortable, with the exception of an old-fashioned horse-hair sofa which Angela thought she had never seen equalled for its black shininess and its promise of stark discomfort.  On entering the apartment she had felt per turbed, but as soon as she saw Anthony and realized that the picture at which he was gazing was an unfinished sketch of herself, her worry fled. He had asked his question without turning, so she addressed his back:  " You can tell me where you found that terrible sofa; I had no idea there were any in existence. Thought they had died out with the Dodo."  The sound of her voice brought him to her side. " Angele, tell me what are you doing here? "  She tried to keep the light touch: "Not until you have told me about the sofa." But his dark, tormented face and the strain under had been suffering for the past week broke down her defence. Swaying, she caught at his hand. " Anthony, Anthony, how could you?"  He put his arm about her and led her to the despised sofa; looked at her moodily. " Why did you come to see me, Angele? "  Ordinarily she would have fenced, indulged in some fancy skirmishing; but this was no ordinary occasion; indeed in ordinary circumstances she would not have been here. She spoke gravely and proudly.  " Because I love you. Because I think you love me." A sudden terrible fear assailed her. " Oh, Anthony, don't tell me you were only playing ! "  " With you? So little was I playing that the moment I began to suspect you cared, and I        never dreamed of it until that last day in the park, I ran away from you. I knew you had so many resources; men will always adore you, want you, that I thought you'd soon forget; turn to someone else just as you had turned for a sudden whim to me from God knows how many admirers."  She shook her head, but she was frightened; some nameless fear knocking at her heart. " I turned to you from no one, Anthony. I've had only one ' admirer ' as you call it in New York and I had long, long since ceased thinking of him. No, Anthony, I came to you because I needed you ; you of all men in New York. I think in the world. And I thought you needed me."  They sat in silence on the terrible sofa. He seized her hand and covered it with kisses; started to take her in his arms, then let them fall in a hope less gesture.  " It's no good, Angel; there's no use trying to buck fate. Life has caught us again. What you're talking about is absolutely impossible."  " What do you mean, impossible? " The little mute fear that had lain within her for a long time as a result of an earlier confidence of his bestirred itself, spoke.  " Anthony, those men, those enemies that killed your father, did you kill one of them? " She had her arms about him. " You know it's nothing to me. Don't even tell me about it. Your past belongs to you; it's your future I'm interested in, that I want."  He pushed her from him, finally, even roughly. " No, I've never killed a man. Though I've wanted to. But I was a little boy when it all happened and afterwards I wouldn't go back          because of my mother." He went over to a drawer and took out a revolver, " I've half a mind to kill myself now, now before I go mad thinking how I've broken my promise, broken it after all these years." He looked at her wistfully, yet implacably. " I wish that I had died long before it was given to me to see that beautiful, loving look on your face change into one of hatred and dread and anger."  She thought he must be raving; she tried to sooth him. " Never mind, Anthony; I don't care a rap about what you've done. Only tell me why do you say everything's impossible for us? Why can't we mean everything to each other, be married -- "  " Because I'm coloured." In her bewildered relief she fell away from him.  " Yes, that's right, you damned American ! I'm not fit for you to touch now, am I? It was all right as long as you thought I was a murderer, a card sharp, a criminal, but the black blood in me is a bit too much, isn't it?" Beside himself he rushed to the windows, looked on the placid Sunday groups festooning the front steps of the brown stone houses. " What are you going to do, alarm the neighbourhood? Well, let me tell you, my girl, before they can get up here I'll be dead." His glance strayed to the revolver. " They'll never catch me as they did my father."  It was on the point of her tongue to tell him her great secret. Her heart within her bubbled with laughter to think how quickly she could put an end to this hysteria, how she could calm this black madness which so seethed within him, poisoning the very spring of his life. But his last      ? >  words turned her thoughts to something else, to another need. How he must have suffered, loving a girl who he felt sure would betray him ; yet scorn ing to keep up the subterfuge.  She said to him gently: "Anthony, did you think I would do that? "  His answer revealed the unspeakable depths of his acquaintance with prejudice; his incurable cynicism. " You're a white American. I know there's nothing too dastardly for them to attempt where colour is involved."  A fantastic notion seized her. Of course she would tell him that she was coloured, that she was willing to live with coloured people. And if he needed assurance of her love, how much more fully would he believe in her when he realized that not even for the sake of the conveniences to be had by passing would she keep her association with white people secret from him. But first she must try to restore his faith in human good ness. She said to him gently: " Tell me about it, Anthony."  And sitting there in the ugly, tidy room in the sunshot duskiness of the early summer evening, the half-subdued noises of the street mounting up to them, he told her his story. An old story it was, but in its new setting, coupled with the fact that Angela for years had closed her mind to the penalty which men sometimes pay for being " different ", it sounded like some unbelievable tale from the Inquisition.  His father, John Hall, of Georgia, had been a sailor and rover, but John's father was a well- known and capable farmer who had stayed in his little town and slowly amassed what seemed a          fortune to the poor and mostly ignorant whites by whom he was surrounded. In the course of John's wanderings he had landed at Rio de Janeiro and he had met Maria Cruz, a Brazilian with the blood of many races in her veins. She herself was apparently white, but she looked with favour on the brown, stalwart sailor, thinking nothing of his colour, which was very much the same as that of her own father. The two married and went to many countries. But finally John, wearying of his aimless life, returned to his father, arriving a month before it was time to receive the old man's blessing and his property. Thence all his troubles. Certain white men in the neighbour hood had had their eyes turned greedily on old Anthony Hall's possessions. His son had been a wanderer for many years; doubtless he was dead. Certainly it was not expected that he would return after all these years to his native soil; most niggers leaving the South left for ever. They knew better than to return with their uppity ways.  Added to the signal injustice of John Hall's return and the disappointment caused thereby, was the iniquity of his marriage to a beautiful and apparently white wife. Little Anthony could remember his father's constant admonition to her never to leave the house; the latter had, in his sudden zeal for home, forgotten what a sojourn in Georgia could mean. But his memory was soon refreshed and he was already making every effort to dispose of his new possessions without total loss. This required time and patience, but he hoped that only a few months need elapse before they might shake off the dust of this cursed hole for ever.  T        "Just a little patience, Maria," he told his lovely wife.  But she could not understand. True, she never ventured into the town, but an infrequent visit to the little store was imperative and she did not mind an occasional admiring glance. Indeed she attributed her husband's admonitions to his not unwelcome jealousy. Anthony, always a grave child, constituted himself her constant guardian; his father, he knew, had to be away in neigh bouring townships where he was trying to put through his deal, so the little boy accompanied his silly trusting mother everywhere. When they passed a group of staring, mouthing men he con trived to hurt his finger or stub his toe so as to divert his mother's attention. In spite of his childish subterfuges, indeed because of them, his mother attracted the notice of Tom Haley, son of the magistrate. Anthony apparently had injured his hand and his beautiful mother, bending over it with great solicitude, made a picture too charm ing, too challenging to be overlooked. Haley stepped forward, actually touched his cap. " Can I do anything to help you, ma'am? " She looked at him with her lovely, melting eyes, spoke in her foreign liquid voice. He was sure he had made a conquest. Afterwards, chagrined by the gibes of the bystanders who jeered at him for his courtesy to a nigger wench " for that's all she is, John Hall's wife ", he ground his heel in the red dust; he would show her a thing or two.  In the hot afternoon, awakened from her siesta by a sudden knock, she came to the door, greeted her admirer of the early morning. She was not quite pleased with the look in his eyes, but        she could not suspect evil. Haley, who had done some wandering on his own account and had picked up a few words of Spanish, let fall an insulting phrase or two. Amazed and angry she struck him across his face. The boy, Anthony, uneasily watching, screamed; there was a sudden tumult of voices and Haley fled, forgetting for the moment that these were Negro voices and so need not be dreaded. An old coloured man, mumbling and groaning " Gawd forgive you, Honey; we'se done fer now " guided the child and the panic-stricken mother into the swamp And lying there hidden at night they could see the sparks and flames rising from the house and buildings, which represented the labour of Anthony Hall's sixty years. In a sudden lull they caught the sounds of the pistol shots which riddled John Hall's body.  " Someone warned my father," said Anthony Cross wearily, " but he would go home. Besides, once back in town he would have been taken anyway, perhaps mobbed and burned in the public square. They let him get into his house; he washed and dressed himself for death. Before nightfall the mob came to teach this man their opinion of a nigger who hadn't taught his wife her duty toward white men. First they set fire to the house, then called him to the window. He stepped out on a little veranda; Haley opened fire. The body fell over the railing, dead before it could touch the ground, murdered by the bullets from twenty pistols. Souvenir hunters cut off fingers, toes, his ears, a friend of my grandfather found the body at night and buried it. They said it was unlike anything they had ever seen before,          totally dehumanized. After I heard that story I was unable to sleep for nights on end. As for my mother, -- '"  Angela pressed his head close against her shoulder. There were no words for a thing like this, only warm human contact.  He went on wanly. " As for my mother, she was like a madwoman. She has gone all the rest of her life haunted by a terrible fear."  " Of white people," Angela supplemented softly. " Yes, I can see how she would."  He glanced at her sombrely. " No, of coloured people. She believes that we, particularly the dark ones, are cursed, otherwise why should we be so abused, so hounded. Two years after my father's death she married a white man, not an American that was spared me, but a German who, I believe, treats her very kindly. I was still a little boy but I begged and pleaded with her to leave the whole race alone; I told her she owed it to the memory of my father. But she only said women were poor, weak creatures; they must take protection where they could get it."  Horrified, mute with the tragedy of it all, she could only stare at him white-lipped.  " Don't ask me how I came up. Angele, for a time I was nothing, worthless,, only I have never denied my colour; I have always taken up with coloured causes. When I've had a special point to make I've allowed the world to think of me as it would but always before severing my connections I told of the black blood that was in my veins. And then it came to me that for my father's sake I would try to make something of myself. So I sloughed off my evil ways, they had been assumed        only in bravado, and came to New York where I've been living quietly, I hope usefully, keeping my bitterness within myself where it could harm no one but me.  " I made one vow and kept it, never by any chance to allow myself to become entangled with white people; never to listen to their blandish ments; always to hate them with a perfect hate. Then I met you and loved you and somehow healing began. I thought, if she loves me she'll be willing to hear me through. And if after she hears me she is willing to take me, black blood and all, but mind," he interrupted himself fiercely, " I'm not ashamed of my blood. Some times I think it's the leaven that will purify this Nordic people of their cruelty and their savage lust of power."  She ignored this. " So you were always going to tell me."  " Tell you? Of course I would have told you. Oh, I'm a man, Angel, with a man's record. When I was a sailor, there' re some pages in my life I couldn't let your fingers touch. But that I'd have told you, it was too vital, too important. Not that I think it really means anything, this mixture of blood, as life goes, as God meant the world to go. But here in America it could make or mar life. Of course I'd have told you."  Here was honour, here was a man ! So would her father have been. Having found this com parison her mind sought no further.  A deep silence descended upon them; in his case the silence of exhaustion. But Angela was thinking of his tragic life and of how completely, how surprisingly she could change it. Smiling,        she spoke to him of happiness, of the glorious future. " I've something amazing to tell you, but I won't spring it on you all at once. Can't we go out to Van Cortlandt Park to-morrow evening? "  He caught her hand. " No matter what in the goodness of your heart you may be planning, there is no future, none, none, Angel, for you and me. Don't deceive yourself, nor me. When I'm with you I forget sometimes. But this afternoon has brought it all back to me. I'll never forget myself and my vow again."  A bell shrilled three, four times.  He looked about frowning. "That's Sanchez; he's forgotten his key again. My dear girl, my Angel, you must go, and you must not, must not come back. Hurry, hurry ! I don't want him to see you here." He guided her towards the door, stemming her protestations. " I'll write you at once, but you must go. God bless and keep you."  In another moment she was out in the dim hall, passing a dark, hurrying figure on the stairs. The heavy door swung silently behind her, thrusting her inexorably out into the engulfing summer night; the shabby pretentious house was again between her and Anthony with his tragic, searing past.          ALL the next day and the next she dwelt on Anthony's story; she tried to put herself in his place, to force herself into a dim realization of the dark chamber of torture in which his mind and thoughts had dwelt for so many years. And she had added her modicum of pain, had been so unsympathetic, so unyielding; in the midst of the dull suffering, the sickness of life to which perhaps his nerves had become accustomed she had managed to inject an extra pinprick of poignancy. Oh, she would reward him for that; she would brim his loveless, cheated existence with joy and sweet ness; she would cajole him into forgetting that terrible past. Some day he should say to her: " You have brought me not merely new life, but life itself." Those former years should mean no more to him than its pre-natal existence means to a baby.  Her fancy dwelt on, toyed with all the sweet offices of love; the delicate bondage that could knit together two persons absolutely en rapport. At the cost of every ambition which she had ever known she would make him happy. After the manner of most men his work would probably be the greatest thing in the world to him. And he should be the greatest thing in the world to her. He should be her task, her "job ", the fulfilment          of her ambition. A phrase from the writings of Anatole France came drifting into her mind. " There is a technique of love." She would dis cover it, employ it, not go drifting haphazardly, carelessly into this relationship. And suddenly she saw her affair with Roger in a new light; she could forgive him, she could forgive herself for that hitherto unpardonable union if through it she had come one iota nearer to the understanding and the need of Anthony.  His silence for although the middle of the week had passed she had received no letter, worried her not one whit. In the course of time he would come to her, remembering her perfect sympathy of the Sunday before and thinking that this woman was the atonement for what he considered her race. And then she would surprise him, she would tell him the truth, she would make herself inexpressibly dearer and nearer to him when he came to know that her sympathy and her tender ness were real, fixed and lasting, because they were based and rooted in the same blood, the same experiences, the same comprehension of this far-reaching, stupid, terrible race problem. How inexpressibly happy, relieved and over whelmed he would be ! She would live with him in Harlem, in Africa, anywhere, any place. She would label herself, if he asked it; she would tell every member of her little coterie of white friends about her mixed blood; she would help him keep his vow and would glory in that keeping. No sacrifice of the comforts which came to her from " passing ", of the assurance, even of the safety which the mere physical fact of whiteness in America brings, would be too great for her. She        would withdraw where he withdrew, hate where he hated.    His letter which came on Thursday interrupted her thoughts, her fine dreams of self-immolation which women so adore. It was brief and stern, and read:  " Angele, don't think for one moment that I do not thank you for Sunday. . . . My heart is at your feet for what you revealed to me then. But you and I have nothing in common, have never had, and now can never have. More than race divides us. I think I shall go away. Meanwhile you are to forget me; amuse your self, beautiful, charming, magnetic Angel with the men of your own race and leave me to my own.  " ANTHONY."  It was such a strange letter; its coldness and finality struck a chill to her heart. She looked at the lonely signature, " Anthony ", just that, no word of love or affection. And the phrase: " More than race divides us." Its hidden signifi cance held a menace.  The letter was awaiting her on her return from work. She had come in all glowing with the promise of the future as she conceived it. And then here were these cold words killing her high hopes as an icy blast kills the too trusting blossoms of early spring. . . . Holding the letter she let her supper go untasted, unregarded, while she evolved some plan whereby she could see Anthony,      talk to him. The tone of his letter did not sound as though he would yield to ordinary persuasion. And again in the midst of her bewilderment and suffering she was struck afresh with the difficulties inherent in womanhood in conducting the most ordinary and most vital affairs of life. She was still a little bruised in spirit that she had taken it upon herself to go to Anthony's rooms Sunday; it was a step she felt conventionally, whose justi fication lay only in its success. As long as she had considered it successful, she had been able to relegate it to the uttermost limbo of her self- consciousness. But now that it seemed to avail nothing it loomed up before her in all its social significance. She was that creature whom men, in their selfish fear, have contrived to paint as the least attractive of human kind, " a girl who runs after men." It seemed to her that she could not stand the application of the phrase, no matter how unjustly, how inaptly used in her own case. Looking for a word of encouragement she re-read the note. The expression " My heart is at your feet" brought some reassurance; she remem bered, too, his very real emotion of Sunday, only a few days before. Men, real men, men like Anthony, do not change. No, she could not let him go without one last effort. She would go to Harlem once more to his house, she would see him, reassure him, allay his fears, quench his silly apprehensions of non-compatability. As soon as he knew that they were both coloured, he'd succumb. Now he was overwrought. It had never occurred to her before that she might be glad to be coloured. . . . She put on her hat, walked slowly out the door, said to herself with      a strange foreboding: " When I see this room again, I'll either be very happy, or very, very sad. ..." Her courage rose, braced her, but she was sick of being courageous, she wanted to be a beloved woman, dependent, fragile, sought for, feminine; after this last ordeal she would be " womanly " to the point of ineptitude. . . .  During the long ride her spirits rose a little. After all, his attitude was almost inevitable. He thought she belonged to a race which to him stood for treachery and cruelty; he had seen her with Roger, Roger, the rich, the gay; he saw her as caring only for wealth and pleasure. Of course in his eyes she was separated from him by race and by more than race.  For long years she was unable to reconstruct that scene; her mind was always too tired, too sore to re-enact it.  As in a dream she saw Anthony's set, stern face, heard his firm, stern voice: "Angel-girl, Angele I told you not to come back. I told you it was all impossible."  She found herself clutching at his arm, blurt ing out the truth, forgetting all her elaborate plans, her carefully pre-concerted drama. " But, Anthony, Anthony, listen, everything's all right. I'm coloured; I've suffered too; nothing has to come between us."  For a moment off his guard he wavered. " An gele, I didn't think you'd lie to me."  She was in tears, desperate. " I'm not lying, Anthony. It's perfectly true."  " I saw that picture of your mother, a white woman if I ever saw one, "        " Yes, but a white coloured woman. My father was black, perfectly black and I have a sister, she's brown. My mother and I used to ' pass ' some times just for the fun of it; she didn't mind being coloured. But I minded it terribly, until very recently. So I left my home, in Philadelphia, and came here to live, oh, going for white makes life so much easier. You know it, Anthony." His face wan and terrible frightened her. " It doesn't make you angry, does it ? You've passed yourself, you told me you had. Oh Anthony, Anthony, don't look at me like that! What is it?"  She caught at his hand, following him as he withdrew to the shiny couch where they both sat breathless for a moment. " God ! " he said sud denly; he raised his arms, beating the void like a madman. " You in your foolishness, I in my carelessness, c passing, passing ' and life sitting back laughing, splitting her sides at the joke of it. Oh, it was all right for you, but I didn't care whether people thought I was white or coloured, if we'd only known, "  " What on earth are you talking about? It's all right now."  " It isn't all right; it's worse than ever." He caught her wrist. " Angel, you're sure you're not fooling me? "  " Of course I'm not. I have proof, I've a sister right here in New York; she's away just now. But when she comes back, I'll have you meet her. She is brown and lovely, you'll want to paint her . . . don't you believe me, Anthony? "  " Oh yes, I believe you," he raised his arms again in a beautiful, fluid gesture, let them fall. " Oh,          damn life, damn it, I say . . . isn't there any end to pain ! "  Frightened, she got on her knees beside him. " Anthony, what's the matter? Everything's going to be all right; we're going to be happy."  " You may be. I'll never be happy. You were the woman I wanted, I thought you were white. For my father's sake I couldn't marry a white girl. So I gave you up."  " And I wouldn't stay given up. See, here I am back again. You'll never be able to send me away." Laughing but shamefaced, she tried to thrust herself into his arms.  " No, Angel, no ! You don't understand There's, there's somebody else -- "  She couldn't take it in. " Somebody else. You mean, you're married? Oh Anthony, you don't mean you're married ! "  " No, of course not, of course not ! But I'm engaged."  " Engaged, engaged and not to me, to another girl? And you kissed me, went around with me? I knew other men did that, but I never thought that of you ! I thought you were like my father ! " And she began to cry like a little girl.  Shame-faced, he looked on, jamming his hands tightly into his pockets. " I never meant to harm you; I never thought until that day in the park that you would care. And I cared so terribly! Think, I had given you up, Angele, I suppose that isn't your name really, is it? and all of a sudden, you came walking back into my life and I said, ' I'll have the laugh on this damned mess after all. I'll spend a few days with her, love her a little, just a little. She'll never know, and I'll          have a golden memory! Oh, I had it coming to me, Angel! But the minute I saw you were beginning to care I broke off short."  A line from an old text was running through her head, rendering her speechless, inattentive. She was a little girl back in the church again in Philadelphia; the minister was intoning " All we like sheep have gone astray". He used to put the emphasis on the first word and Jinny and she would look at each other and exchange meaning smiles; he was a West Indian and West Indians had a way of misplacing the emphasis. The line sounded so funny: " All we like sheep, -- " but perhaps it wasn't so funny after all; perhaps he had read it like that not because he was a West Indian but because he knew life and human nature. Certainly she had gone astray, with Roger. And now here was Anthony, Anthony who had always loved her so well. Yet in his background there was a girl and he was engaged.  This brought her to a consideration of the un known fiancee, her rival. Deliberately she chose the word, for she was not through yet. This unknown, unguessed at woman who had stolen in like a thief in the night. . . .  " Have you known her long? " she asked him sharply.  " Who? Oh my, my friend. No, not as long as I've known you."  A newcomer, an upstart. Well at least she, Angela, had the advantage of precedence.  " She's coloured, of course? "  "Of course."  They sat in a weary silence. Suddenly he caught her in his arms and buried his head in her neck.        A quick pang penetrated to the very core of her being. He must have been an adorable baby. . . . Anthony and babies !  " Now God, Life, whatever it is that has power, this time you must help me ! " cried her heart. She spoke to him gently.  " Anthony, you know I love you. Do you still love me? "  " Always, always, Angel."  " Do you Oh, Anthony, I don't deserve it, but do you by any chance worship me? "  " Yes, that's it, that's just it, I worship you. I adore you. You are God to me. Oh, Angele, if you'd only let me know. But it's too late now."  " No, no don't say that, perhaps it isn't too late. It all depends on this. Do you worship her, Anthony? " He lifted his haggard face.  "No but she worships me. I'm God to her do you see? If I fail her she won't say anything, she'll just fall back like a little weak kitten, like a lost sheep, like a baby. She'll die." He said as though unaware of his listener. " She's such a little thing. And sweet."  Angela said gently: "Tell me about her. Isn't it all very sudden? You said you hadn't known her long."  He began obediently. " It was not long after I I lost you. She came to me out of nowhere, came walking to me into my room by mistake; she didn't see me. And she put her head down on her hands and began to cry terribly. I had been crying too in my heart, you understand, and for a moment I thought she might be the echo of that cry, might be the cry itself. You see,          I'd been drinking a little, you were so far removed, white and all that sort of thing. I couldn't marry a white woman, you know, not a white American. I owed that to my father.  " But at last I saw it was a girl, a real girl and I went over to her and put my hand on her shoulder and said: { Little girl, what's the matter? '  " And she lifted her head, still hidden in the crook of her arm, you know the way a child does and said : ' I've lost my sister '. At first I thought she meant lost in the street and I said ' Well, come with me to the police station, I'll go with you, we'll give them a description and you'll find her again. People don't stay lost in this day and time '. I got her head on my shoulder, I almost took her on my knee, Angele, she was so simple and forlorn. And presently she said : ' No, I don't mean lost that way; I mean she's left me, she doesn't want me any more. She wants other people '. And I've never been able to get anything else out of her. The next morning I called her up and some how I got to seeing her, for her sake, you know. But afterwards when she grew happier, she was so blithe, so lovely, so healing and blessed like the sun or a flower, then I saw she was getting fond of me and I stayed away.  " Well, I ran across you and that Fielding fellow that night at the Van Meier lecture. And you were so happy and radiant, and Fielding so pos sessive, damn him ! damn him ! he you didn't let him hurt you, Angele? "  As though anything that had ever happened in her life could hurt her like this! She had never known what pain was before. White-lipped, she shook her head. " No, he didn't hurt me."          " Well, I went to see her the next day. She came into the room like a shadow, I realized she was getting thin. She was kind and sweet and far-off; impalpable, tenuous and yet there. I could see she was dying for me. And all of a sudden it came to me how wonderful it would be to have someone care like that. I went to her; I took her in my arms and I said: 'Child, child, I'm not bringing you a whole heart but could you love me? ' You see I couldn't let her go after that."  " No," Angela's voice was dull, lifeless. " You couldn't. She'd die."  " Yes, that's it; that's just it. And I know you won't die, Angel."  " No, you're quite right. I won't die."  An icy hand was on her heart. At his first words: an icy echo stirred a memory deep, deep within her inner consciousness. She heard Jinny saying : " I went walking into his room, -- "  Something stricken, mortally stricken in her face fixed his attention. " Don't look like that, my girl, my dear Angel. . . . There are three of us in this terrible plight, if I had only known. ... I don't deserve the love of either of you but if one of you two must suffer it might as well be she as you. Come, we'll go away; even unhappiness, even remorse will mean something to us as long as we're together."  She shook her head. " No, that's impossible, if it were someone else, I don't know, perhaps I'm so sick of unhappiness, maybe I'd take a chance. But in her case it's impossible."  He looked at her curiously. " What do you mean 'in her case'?"  u      :< Isn't her name Virginia Murray? "  " Yes, yes ! How did you guess it? Do you know her? "  " She's my sister. Angele Mory, Angela Mur ray, don't you see. It's the same name. And it's all my fault. I pushed her, sent her deliberately into your arms."  He could only stare.  " I'm the unkind sister who didn't want her. Oh, can't you understand? That night she came walking into your room by mistake it was because I had gone to the station to meet her and Roger Fielding came along. I didn't want him to know that I was coloured and I, I didn't acknowledge her, I cut her."  " Oh," he said surprised and inadequate. " I don't see how you could have done that to a little girl like Virginia. Did she know New York? "  " No." She drooped visibly. Even the loss of him was nothing compared to this rebuke. There seemed nothing further to be said.  Presently he put his arm about her. " Poor Angele. As though you could foresee ! It's what life does to us, leads us into pitfalls apparently so shallow, so harmless and when we turn around there we are, caught, fettered, "  Her miserable eyes sought his. " I was sorry right away, Anthony. I tried my best to get in touch with her that very evening. But I couldn't find her, already you see, life was getting even with me, she had strayed into your room."  He nodded. " Yes, I remember it all so plainly. I was getting ready to go out, was all prepared as a matter of fact. Indeed I moved that very night. But I loitered on and on, thinking of you.      " The worst of it is I'll always be thinking of you. Oh Angele, what does it matter, what does any thing matter if we just have each other? This damned business of colour, is it going to ruin all chances of happiness? I've known trouble, pain, terrible devastating pain all my life. You've suffered too. Together perhaps we could find peace. We'd go to your sister and explain. She is kind and sweet; surely she'd understand."  He put his arms about her and the two clung to each other, solemnly, desperately, like children.  " I'm sick of pain, too, Anthony, sick of longing and loneliness. You can't imagine how I've suffered from loneliness."  " Yes, yes I can. I guessed it. I used to watch you. I thought you were probably lonely inside, you were so different from Miss Lister and Mrs. Starr. Come away with me and we'll share our loneliness together, somewhere where we'll for- get, "  " And Virginia? You said yourself she'd die, "  " She's so young, she she could get over it." But his tone was doubtful, wavering.  She tore herself from him. " No, I took her sister away from her; I won't take her lover. Kiss me good-bye, Anthony."  They sat on the hard sofa. " To think we should find one another only to lose each other ! To think that everything, every single thing was all right for us but that we were kept apart by the stupidity of fate. I'd almost rather we'd never learned the truth. Put your dear arms^ about me closer, Angel, Angel. I want the warmth, the sweetness of you to penetrate into my heart. I want to      keep it there forever. Darling, how can I let you go? "  She clung to him weeping, weeping with the heart-broken abandonment of a child.  A bell shrilled four times.  He jumped up. " It's Sanchez, he's forgotten his key; thank God he did forget it. My darling, you must go. But wait for me. I'll meet you, we'll go to your house, we'll find a way. We can't part like this ! " His breath was coming in short gasps; she could see little white lines deepening about his mouth, his nostrils. Fearfully she caught at her hat.  " God bless you; good-bye Anthony. I won't see you again."  Halfway down the black staircase she met the heedless Sanchez, tall, sallow, thin, glancing at her curiously with a slightly amused smile. Politely he stood aside to let her pass, one hand resting lightly against his hip. Something in his attitude made her think of her unfinished sketch of Life. Hysterical, beside herself, she rushed down the remaining steps afraid to look around lest she should see the thin dark figure in pursuit, lest her ears should catch the expansion of that faint meaning smile into a guffaw, uproarious, menacing.          ONCE long ago in the old days in the house on Opal Street she had been taken mysteriously ill. As a matter of fact she had been coming down with that inglorious disease, the mumps. The expense of having a doctor was a consideration, and so for twenty-four hours she was the object of anxious solicitude for the whole house. Her mother had watched over her all night; her father came home twice in the day to see how she felt; Jinny had with some reluctance bestowed on her an oft-coveted, oft-refused doll. In the midst of all her childish pain and suffering she had realized that at least her agony was shared, that her tribulation was understood. But now she was ill with a sickness of the soul and there was no one with whom she could share her anguish.  For two days she lay in her little room; Mrs. Denver, happening in, showered upon her every attention. There was nothing, nothing that Angela could suggest, the little fluttering lady said sin cerely, which she might not have. Angela wished that she would go away and leave her alone, but her experiences had rendered her highly sensitive to the needs of others; Mrs. Denver, for all her money, her lack of responsibility, her almost childish appetite for pleasure, was lonely too; waiting on the younger, less fortunate woman gave      her a sense of being needed ; she was pathetically glad when the girl expressed a desire for anything no matter how expensive or how trivial. Angela could not deprive her entirely of those doubtful pleasures. Still there were moments, of course, when even Mrs. Denver for all her kindly officious- ness had to betake herself elsewhere and leave her willing patient to herself and her thoughts.  Minutely, bit by bit, in the long forty-eight hours she went over her life; was there anything, any over tact, any crime which she had committed and for which she might atone? She had been selfish, yes; but, said her reasoning and unwearied mind, " Everybody who survives at all is selfish, it is one of the pre-requisites of survival." In " pass ing " from one race to the other she had done no harm to anyone. Indeed she had been forced to take this action. But she should not have forsaken Virginia. Here at this point her brain, so clear and active along all other lines, invariably failed her. She could not tell what stand to take; so far as leaving Philadelphia was concerned she had left it to seek her fortune under more agreeable circumstances ; if she had been a boy and had left home no one would have had a word of blame, it would have been the proper thing, to be expected and condoned. There remained then only the particular incident of her cutting Jinny on that memorable night in the station. That was the one really cruel and unjust action of her whole life.  " Granted," said something within her rooted either in extreme hard common sense or else in a vast sophistry, " granted, but does that carry with it as penalty the shattering of a whole life, or even the suffering of years? Certainly the punishment        is far in excess of the crime." And it was then that she would lie back exhausted, hopeless, bewildered, unable to cope further with the myterious and apparently meaningless ferocity of life. For if this were a just penalty for one serious misde meanour, what compensation should there not be for the years in which she had been a dutiful daughter, a loving sister? And suddenly she found herself envying people possessed of a blind religious faith, of the people who could bow the head sub missively and whisper: "Thy will be done." For herself she could see how beaten and harried, one might subside into a sort of blind passivity, an acceptance of things as they are, but she would never be able to understand a force which gave one the imagination to paint a great desire, the tenacity to cling to it, the emotionalism to spend on its possible realization but which would then with a careless sweep of the hand wipe out the picture which the creature of its own endowment had created.  More than once the thought came to her of dying. But she hated to give up; something innate, something of the spirit stronger than her bodily will, set up a dogged fight, and she was too bruised and sore to combat it. " All right," she said to herself wearily, " I'll keep on living." She thought then of black people, of the race of her parents and of all the odds against living which a cruel, relentless fate had called on them to endure. And she saw them as a people powerfully, almost overwhelmingly endowed with the essence of life. They had to persist, had to survive because they did not know how to die.        Not because she felt like it, but because some day she must begin once more to take up the motions of life, she moved on the third day from her bed to the easy chair, sat there listless and motionless. To-morrow she would return to work, to work and the sick agony of forcing her mind back from its dolorous, painful, vital thoughts to some con sideration of the dull, uninteresting task in hand. God, how she hated that! She remembered studying her lessons as a girl; the intense absorption with which she used to concentrate. Sometimes she used to wonder: " Oh what will it be like when I am grown up; when I won't be studying lessons . . .  Well, this was what it was like. Or no, she was still studying with the same old absorption, an absorption terribly, painfully con centrated, the lessons set down by life. It was useless to revolve in her head the causes for her suffering, they were so trivial, so silly. She said to herself, " There is no sorrow in the world like my sorrow ", and knew even as she said it that some one else, perhaps only in the next block, in the next house, was saying the same thing.  Mrs. Denver tapped lightly, opened the door, came in closing it mysteriously behind her.  " I've a great surprise for you." She went on with an old childish formula: "Will you have it now, or wait till you get it? "  Angela's features twisted into a wan smile. " I believe I'd better have it now. I'm beginning to think I don't care for surprises."  " You'll like this one." She went to the door and ushered in Rachel Salting.  " I know you two want to talk," Mrs. Denver called over her shoulder. " Cheer her up, Rachel,          and I'll bring you both a fine spread in an hour or so." She closed the door carefully behind her.  Angela said, " What's the matter, Rachel? " She almost added, " I hardly knew you." For her friend's face was white and wan with grief and hopelessness; gone was all her dainty freshness, her pretty colour; indeed her eyes, dark, sunken, set in great pools of blackness, were the only note, a terrible note, of relief against that awful white ness.  Angela felt her strength leaving her ; she rose and tottered back to the grateful security of her bed, lay down with an overwhelming sense of thankfulness for the asylum afforded her sudden faintness. In a moment, partly recovered, she motioned to Rachel to sit beside her.'  " Oh," said Rachel, " you've been ill, Mrs. Denver told me. I ought not to come bothering you with my worries. Oh, Angele, I'm so wretched! Whatever shall I do? "  Her friend, watching her, was very gentle. " There're lots of awful things that can happen. I know that, Rachel. Maybe your trouble isn't so bad that it can't be helped. Have you told John about it? " But even as she spoke she sensed that the difficulty in some way concerned John. Her heart contracted at the thought of the pain and suffering to be endured.  " Yes, John knows, it's about him. Angele, we can't marry."  " Can't marry. Why, is he, it can't be that he's involved with some one else ! "  A momentary indignation flashed into Rachel's face bringing back life and colour. For a small space she was the Rachel Salting of the old happy          days. " Involved with some one else ! " The indignation was replaced by utter despair. " How I wish he were ! That at least could be arranged. But this can never be altered. He, I, our parents are dead set against it. Hadn't you ever noticed, Angele? He's a Gentile and I'm a Jew."  "But lots of Jews and Gentiles marry."  "Yes, I know. Only he's a Catholic. But my parents are orthodox they will never consent to my marriage. My father says he'd rather see me dead and my mother just sits and moans. I kept it from her as long as I could, I used to pray about it, I thought God must let it turn out all right, John and I love each other so. But I went up to Utica the other day, John went with me, and we told them. My father drove him out of the house; he said if I married him he'd curse me. I am afraid of that curse. I can't go against them. Oh, Angele, I wish I'd never been born."  It was a delicate situation; Angela had to feel her way; she could think of nothing but the trite and obvious. " After all, Rachel, your parents have lived their lives; they have no business trying to live yours. Personally I think all this pother about race and creed and colour, tommyrot. In your place I should certainly follow my own wishes; John seems to be the man for you."  But Rachel weeping, imbued with the spirit of filial piety, thought it would be selfish.  " Certainly no more selfish than their attempt to regulate your life for you."  " But I'm afraid," said Rachel shivering, " of my father's curse." It was difficult for Angela to sympathize with an attitude so archaic; she        was surprised to find it lurking at the bottom of her friend's well-trained intelligence.  " Love/' she said musing to herself rather than to her friend, " is supposed to be the greatest thing in the world but look how we smother and confine it. Jews mustn't marry Catholics; white people mustn't marry coloured -- "  " Oh well, of course not," Rachel interrupted in innocent surprise. " I wouldn't marry a nigger in any circumstances. Why, would you? "  But Angela's only answer was to turn and, burying her head in her pillow, to burst into unrestrained and bitter laughter. Rachel went flying to call Mrs. Denver.  " Oh come quick, come quick ! Angele's in hyterics. I haven't the ghost of an idea what to do for her!"    Once more the period of readjustment. Once more the determination to take life as she found it; bitter dose after sweet, bitter after sweet. But it seemed to her now that both sweetness and bitter ness together with her high spirit for adventure lay behind her. How now was she to pass through the tepid, tasteless days of her future? She was not quite twenty-seven, and she found herself wondering what life would be like in ten, five, even one years' time. Changes did flow in upon one, she knew, but in her own case she had been so used herself to give the impetus to these changes. Now she could not envisage herself as making a move in any direction. With the new sullenness which seemed to be creeping upon her daily, she      said " Whatever move I make is always wrong. Let life take care of itself." And she saw life, even her own life, as an entity quite outside her own ken and her own directing. She did not care greatly what happened; she would not, it was true, take her own life, but she would not care if she should die. Once if her mind had harboured such thoughts she would have felt an instant self-pity. " What a shame that I so young, so gifted, with spirits so high should meet with death ! " But now her senses were blunting; so much pain and confusion had brought about their inevitable attrition. " I might just as well be unhappy, or meet death as anyone else," she told herself still with that mounting sullenness.  Mrs. Denver, the Sandburgs and Ashley were the only people who saw her. It did seem to Mrs. Denver that the girl's ready, merry manner was a little dimmed ; if her own happy, sunny, vocabulary had known the term she would have daubed her cynical. The quasi-intellectual atmos phere at the Sandburgs suited her to perfection; the faint bitterness which so constantly marred her speech was taken for sophistication, her frequent silences for profoundness; in a small way, aided by her extraordinary good looks and the slight mys tery which always hung about her, she became quite a personage in their entourage; the Sand burgs considered her a splendid find and plumed themselves on having " brought her out ".    The long golden summer, so beautiful with its promise of happiness, so sickening with its actuality          of pain ripened into early, exquisite September. Virginia was home again; slightly more golden, very, very faintly plumper, like a ripening fruit perfected; brimming with happiness, excitement and the most complete content, Angela thought, that she had ever seen in her life.  Jinny sent for the older girl and the two sat on a Sunday morning, away from Sara Pen ton and the other too insistent friends, over on Riverside Drive looking out at the river winding purple and allur ing in the soft autumn haze.  " Weren't you surprised? " asked Jinny. Lacon ically, Angela admitted to no slight amazement. She still loved her sister but more humbly, less achingly than before. Their lives, she thought now would never, could never touch and she was quite reconciled. Moreover, in some of Virginia's re marks there was the hint of the acceptance of such a condition. Something had brought an irrevocable separation. They would always view each other from the two sides of an abyss, narrow but deep, deep.  The younger girl prattled on. " I don't know whether Sara told you his name, Anthony Cross? Isn't it a dear name? "  e Yes, it's a nice name, a beautiful name," said Angela heartily ; when she had learned it was of no consequence. She added without enthusiasm that she knew him already; he had been a member of her class at Cooper Union.  " You don't talk as though you were very much taken with him," said Jinny, making a face. " But never mind, he suits me, no matter whom he doesn't suit." There was that in her countenance which made Angela realize and marvel again at the      resoluteness of that firm young mind. No curse of parents could have kept Virginia from Anthony's arms. As long as Anthony loved her, was satisfied to have her love, no one could come between them. Only if he should fail her would she shrivel up and die.  On the heels of this thought Virginia made an astounding remark : " You know it's just perfect that I met Anthony; he's really been a rock in a weary land. Next to Matthew Henson he will, I'm sure, make me happier than any man in the world." Dreamily she added an afterthought: " And I'll make him happy too, but, oh, Angela, Angela, I always wanted to marry Matthew ! "    The irony of that sent Angela home. Virginia wanting Matthew and marrying Anthony ; Anthony wanting "Angela and marrying Virginia. Her self wanting Anthony and marrying, wanting, no other; unable to think of, even to dream of another lover. The irony of it was so palpable, so ridicu lously palpable that it put her in a better mood; life was bitter but it was amusingly bitter; if she could laugh at it she might be able to outwit it yet. The thought brought Anthony to mind: " If I could only get a laugh on life, Angele ! "  Sobered, she walked from the 'bus stop to Jayne Street. Halfway up ""the narrow, tortuous stair case she caught sight of a man climbing, climbing. He stopped outside her door. " Anthony? " she said to herself while her heart twisted with pain.  " If it is Anthony, " she breathed, and stopped.  But something within her, vital, cruel, persistent,        completed her thought. " If it is Anthony, after what Virginia said this morning, if he knew that he was not the first, that even as there had been one other there might still be others; that Virginia in her bright, hard, shallow youthfulness would not die any more than she had died over Matthew, would console herself for the loss of Anthony even as she had consoled herself for the loss of Matthew ! " But no, what Jinny had told her was in confidence, a confidence from sister to sister. She would never break faith with Jinny again; nor with herself,  " But Anthony," she said to herself in the few remaining seconds left on the staircase, " you were my first love and I think I was yours."  However, the man at the door was not Anthony ; on the contrary he was, she thought, a complete stranger. But as he turned at her footsteps, she found herself looking into the blue eyes of Roger. Completely astounded, she greeted him, " You don't mean it's you, Roger? "  " Yes," he said humbly, shamefacedly, " aren't you going to let me in, Angele? "  " Oh yes, of course, of course " ; she found herself hoping that he would not stay long. She wanted to think and she would like to paint; that idea must have been in the back of her head ever since she had left Jinny. Hard on this thought came another. " Here's Roger. I never expected to see him in these rooms again; perhaps some day Anthony will come back. Oh, God, be kind!"  But she must tear her thoughts away from Anthony. She looked at Roger curiously, search- ingly; in books the man who had treated his        sweetheart unkindly often returned beaten, de jected, even poverty-stricken, but Roger, except for a slight hesitation in his manner, seemed as jaunty, as fortunate, as handsome as ever. He was even a trifle stouter.  Contrasting him with Anthony's hard-bitten leanness, she addressed him half absently. " I believe you're actually getting fat ! "  His quick high flush revealed his instant sensi tiveness to her criticism. But he was humble. :f That's all right, Angele. I deserve anything you choose to say if you'll just say it."  She was impervious to his mood, utterly indiffer ent, so indifferent that she was herself unaware of her manner. " Heavens, I've sort of forgotten, but I don't remember your ever having been so eager for criticism heretofore ! "  He caught at one phrase. " Forgotten ! You don't mean to say you've forgotten the past and all that was once so dear to us? "  Impatience overwhelmed her. She wished he would go and leave her to her thoughts and to her picture; such a splendid idea had come to her; it was the first time for weeks that she had felt like working. Aware of the blessed narcotic value of interesting occupation, she looked forward to his departure with a sense of relief; even hoped with her next words to pre cipitate it.  " Roger, you don't mean to say that you called on me on a hot September Sunday just to talk to me in that theatrical manner? I don't mind telling you I've a million things to do this after noon; let's get down to bed rock so we can both be up and doinff."      She had been sitting, almost lolling at ease in the big chair, not regarding him, absently twisting a scarf in her fingers. Now she glanced up and something in the hot blueness of his eyes brought her to an upright position, alert, attentive.  " Angele, you've got to take me back."  " Back ! I don't know what you're talking about. Between you and me there is no past, so don't mention it. If you've nothing better to say than that, you might as well get out."  He tried to possess himself of her hands but she shook him off, impatiently, angrily, with no pretence at feeling. " Go away, Roger. I don't want to be bothered with you ! " This pinchbeck emotionalism after the reality of her feeling for Anthony, the sincerity of his feeling for her ! "I won't have this sort of thing; if you won't go I will." She started for the door but he barred her way, suddenly straight and serious.  " No listen, Angele, you must listen. I'm in earnest this time. You must forgive me for the past, for the things I said. Oh, I was unspeakable ! But I had it in my head, you don't know the things a man has borne in on him about designing  women, if he's got anything, family, money, "  she could see him striving to hide his knowledge of his vast eligibility. " I thought you were trying to ' get ' me, it made me suspicious, angry. I knew you were poor, "  " And nobody ! Oh say it, say it ! "  " Well, I will say it. According to my father's standards, nobody. And when you began to take an interest in me, in my affairs, "  ' You thought I was trying to marry you. Well, at first I was. I was poor, I was nobody ! I  x        wanted to be rich, to be able to see the world, to help people. And then when you and I came so near to each other I didn't care about marriage at all -just about living ! Oh, I suppose my attitude was perfectly pagan. I hadn't meant to drift into such a life, all my training was against it, you can't imagine how completely my training was against it. And then for a time I was happy. I'm afraid I didn't love you really, Roger, indeed I know now that in a sense I didn't love you, but somehow life seemed to focus into an absolute perfection. Then you became petulant, ugly, suspicious, afraid of my interest, of my tenderness. And I thought, c I can't let this all end in a flame of ugliness; it must be possible for people to have been lovers and yet remain friends.' I tried so hard to keep things so that it would at least remain a pleasant memory. But you resented my efforts. What I can't under stand is why shouldn't I, if I wanted to, either try to marry you or to make an ideal thing of our relationship? Why is it that men like you resent an eflort on our part to make our commerce decent? Wei], it's all over now. . . . Theoretically ' free love ' or whatever you choose to call it, is all right. Actually, it's all wrong. I don't want any such relationship with you or with any other man in this world. Marriage was good enough for my mother, it's good enough for me."  " There's nothing good enough for you, Angele; but marriage is the best thing that I have to offer and I'm offering you just that. And it's precisely because you were honest and frank and decent and tried to keep our former relationship from deteriorating into sordidness that I am back."        Clearly she was staggered. Marriage with Roger meant protection, position, untold wealth, unlimited opportunities for doing good. Once how she would have leapt to such an offer !  " What's become of Garlotta? " she asked bluntly.  " She's on the eve of marrying Tom Estes, a fellow who was in college with me. He has heaps more money than I. Carlotta thought she'd better take him on  " I see." She looked at him thoughtfully, then the remembrance of her great secret came to her, a secret which she could never share with Roger. No ! No more complications and their conse quent disaster ! " No, no, we won't talk about it any more. What you want is impossible; you can't guess how completely impossible."  He strode toward her, seized her hands. " I'm in earnest, Angele; you've no idea how tired I am of loneliness and uncertainty and, and of seeking women; I want someone whom I can love and trust, whom I can teach to love me, we could get married to-morrow. There's not an obstacle in our way."  His sincerity left her unmoved. " What would your father say? "  " Oh, we wouldn't be able to tell him yet; he'd never consent! Of course we'd have to keep things quiet, just ourselves and one or two friends, Martha and Ladislas perhaps, would be in the know."  More secrets ! She pulled her hands away from him. " Oh Roger, Roger ! I wouldn't consider it. No, when I marry I want a man, a man, a real one, someone not afraid to go on his own ! " She      actually pushed him toward the door. " Some people might revive dead ashes, but not you and I. ... I'd never be able to trust you again and I'm sick of secrets and playing games with human relationships. I'm going to take my friendships straight hereafter. Please go. I've had a hard summer and I'm very tired. Besides I want to work."  Baffled, he looked at her, surprise and indigna tion struggling in his face. " Angele, are you sure you know what you're doing? I've no intention of coming back, so you'd better take me now."  " Of course you're not coming back ! I'm sure I wouldn't want you to; my decision is final." Not unsympathetically she laughed up into his doleful face, actually touched his cheek. " If you only knew how much you look like a cross baby ! "    Her newly developed sympathy and understand ing made her think of Ashley. Doubtless Carlotta's defection would hit him very hard. Her con jecture was correct although the effect of the blow was different from what she had anticipated. Ashley was not so perturbed over the actual loss of the girl as confirmed in his opinion that he was never going to be able to form and keep a lasting friend ship. In spite of his wealth, his native timidity had always made him distrustful of himself with women of his own class; a veritable Tony Hardcastle, he spent a great deal of time with women whom he did not actually admire, whom indeed he disliked, because, he said to Angela          wistfully, they were the only ones who took him seriously.  " No one but you and Carlo tta have ever given me any consideration, have ever liked me for myself, Angele."  They were seeing a great deal of each other; in a quiet, unemotional way they were developing a real friendship. Angela had taken up her paint ing again. She had re-entered the classes at Cooper Union and was working with great zest and absorption on a subject which she meant to enter in the competition for scholarships at the school at Fontainebleau. Ashley, who wrote some good verse in the recondite, falsely free style of the present day, fell into the habit of bringing his work down to her little living room, and in the long tender autumn evenings the two worked seriously, with concentration. Ashley had travelled widely and had seen a great deal of life, though usually from the side-lines; Angela for all her lack of wandering, " had lived deeply ", he used to tell her, pondering on some bit of philosophy which she let fall based on the experiences of her diffi cult life.  " You know, in your way you're quite a wonder, Angele; there's a mystery hanging about you; for all your good spirits, your sense of humour, you're like the Duse, you seem to move in an aura of suffering, of the pain which comes from too great sensitivity. And yet how can that be so? You're not old enough, you've had too few contacts to know how unspeakable life can be, how damnably she can get you in wrong, -- "  An enigmatic smile settled on her face. " I don't know about life, Ralph? How do you think      I got the idea for this masterpiece of mine? " She pointed to the painting on which she was then engaged.  ;< That's true, that's true. I've wondered often about that composition; lots of times I've meant to ask you how you came to evolve it. But keep your mystery to yourself, child; it adds to your charm."  About this she had her own ideas. Mystery might add to the charm of personality but it cer tainly could not be said to add to the charm of living. Once she thought that stolen waters were sweetest, but now it was the unwinding road and the open book that most intrigued.  Ashley, she found, for all his shyness, possessed very definite ideas and convictions of his own, was absolutely unfettered in his mode of thought, and quite unmoved by social traditions and standards. An aristocrat if ever there were one, he believed none the less in the essential quality of man and deplored the economic conditions which so often tended to set up superficial and unreal barriers which make as well as separate the classes.  With some trepidation Angela got him on the subject of colour. He considered prejudice the greatest blot on America's shield. " We're wrong, all wrong about those people; after all they did to make America habitable! Some day we're going to wake up to our shame. I hope it won't be too late."  " But you wouldn't want your sister to marry a nigger ! "'  " I'm amazed, Angele, at your using such a word as an exclusive term. I've known some fine coloured people. There're hardly any of unmixed        blood in the United States, so the term Negro is usually a misnomer. I haven't a sister; if I had I'd advise her against marriage with an American coloured man because the social pressure here would probably be too great, but that would be absolutely the only ground on which I'd object to it. And I can tell you this; I wouldn't care to marry a woman from the Congo but if I met a coloured woman of my own nationality, well-bred, beautiful, sympathetic, I wouldn't let the fact of her mixed blood stand in my way, I can tell you."    A sort of secondary interest in living was creeping into her perspective. The high lights, the high peaks had faded from her sight. She would never, she suspected, know such spontaneity of feeling and attitude again as she had felt toward both Roger and Anthony. Nor would she again approach the experiences of existence with the same naive expectation, the same desire to see how things would turn out. Young as she was she felt like a battle-scarred veteran who, worn out from his own strenuous activities, was quite con tent to sit on the side-lines gazing at all phases of warfare with an equal eye.  Although she no longer intended to cast in her lot with Virginia, she made no further effort to set up barriers between herself and coloured people. Let the world take her as it would. If she were in Harlem, in company with Virginia and Sara Penton she went out to dinner, to the noisy, crowded, friendly "Y" dining-room, to " Gert's " tea room, to the clean, inviting drug-store for rich      "sundaes". Often, too, she went shopping with her sister and to the theatre; she had her meet Ashley and Martha. But she was careful in this company to avoid contact with people whose attitude on the race question was unknown, or definitely antagonistic.  Harlem intrigued her; it was a wonderful city; it represented, she felt, the last word in racial pride, integrity and even self-sacrifice. Here were people of a very high intellectual type, exponents of the realest and most essential refinement living cheek by jowl with coarse or ill-bred or even criminal, certainly indifferent, members of their race. Of course some of this propinquity was due to outer pressure, but there was present, too, a hidden consciousness of race-duty, a something which if translated said: " Perhaps you do pull me down a little from the height to which I have climbed. But on the other hand, perhaps, I'm helping you to rise."  There was a hair-dresser's establishment on Ith Street where Virginia used to have her beautiful hair treated; where Sara Pen ton, whose locks were of the same variety as Matthew's, used to repair to have their unruliness " pressed ". Here on Satur days Angela would accompany the girls and sit through the long process just to overhear the conversations, grave and gallant and gay, of these people whose blood she shared but whose disabil ities by a lucky fluke she had been able to avoid. For, while she had been willing for the sake of Anthony to re-enlist in the struggles of this life, she had never closed her eyes to its disad vantages; to its limitedness ! What a wealth of courage it took for these people to live ! What          high degree of humour, determination, steadfast ness, undauntedness were not needed, and poured forth! Maude, the proprietress of the business, for whom the establishment was laconically called " Maude's ", was a slight, sweet-faced woman with a velvety seal-brown skin, a charming voice and an air of real refinement. She was from Texas, but had come to New York to seek her fortune, had travelled as ladies' maid in London and Paris, and was as thoroughly conversant with the arts of her calling as any hairdresser in the vicinity of the Rue de la Paix or on Fifth Avenue. A rare quality of hospitality emanated from her presence; her little shop was always full not only of patrons but of callers, visitors from " down home ", actresses from the current coloured " show ", flitting in like radiant birds of paradise with their rich brown skins, their exotic eyes and the gaily coloured clothing which an unconscious style had evolved just for them.  In this atmosphere, while there was no coarse ness, there was no restriction; life in busy Harlem stopped here and yawned for a delicious moment before going on with its pressure and problems. A girl from Texas, visiting " the big town " for a few weeks took one last glance at her shapely, marvellously " treated " head, poised for a second before the glass and said simply, " Well, good-bye, Maude; I'm off for the backwoods, but I'll never forget Harlem." She passed out with the sinuous elegant carriage acquired in her few week's sojourn on Seventh Avenue.  A dark girl, immaculate in white from head to foot, asked: " What's she going back South for? Ain't she had enough of Texas yet ? "        Maude replied that she had gone back there because of her property. " Her daddy owns most of the little town where they live."  " Child, ain't you learned that you don't never own no property in Texas as long as those white folks are down there too? Just let those Ku Kluxers get it into their heads that you've got something they want. She might just as well leave there first as last; she's bound to have to some day. I know it's more'n a notion to pull up stakes and start all over again in a strange town and a strange climate, but it's the difference between life and death. I know I done it and I don't expect ever to go back."  She was a frail woman, daintily dressed and shod. Her voice was soft and drawling. But Angela saw her sharply as the epitome of the iron and blood in a race which did not know how to let go of life.        MARKET IS DONE      THE eternal routine of life went on, meals, slumber, talk, work and all of it meaning nothing; a void starting nowhere and leading nowhither; a " getting through " with the days. Gradually however two points fixed themselves in her horizon, and about these her life revolved. One was her work, her art. Every week found her spending three or four of its nights at her easel. She was feverishly anxious to win one of the prizes in the contest which would be held in May ; if successful she would send in her application for registration in the Fountainebleau School of Fine Arts which was financed by Americans and established, so read the circular, " as a summer school for American architects, painters and sculptors ". If she were suc cessful in winning this, she would leave the United States for a year or two, thus assuring herself beyond question of a new deal of the cards. The tenacity with which she held to this plan frightened her a little until she found out that there were also possible funds from which she could, with the proper recommendation, borrow enough money to enable her to go abroad with the understanding that the refund was to be made by slow and easy payments. Ashley discovered this saving informa tion, thus relieving her of the almost paralyzing fear which beset her from time to time. It both          amused and saddened her to realize that her talent which she had once used as a blind to shield her real motives for breaking loose and coming to New York had now become the greatest, most real force in her life.  Miss Powell, with whom Angela in her new mood had arranged a successful truce, knew of her ambition, indeed shared it. If she herself should win a prize, that money, combined with some small savings of her own and used in connec tion with the special terms offered by the American Committee, would mean the fruition of her dearest dreams. All this she confided to Angela on two Sunday mornings which the latter spent with her in her rather compressed quarters up in Ith Street. A dwelling house nearby had been con verted into a place of worship for one of the special divisions of religious creed so dear to coloured people's hearts. Most of the service seemed to consist of singing, and so the several hours spent by the two girls in earnest talk were punctuated by the outbursts of song issuing from the brazen- coated throats of the faithful.  The other point about which her thoughts centred was her anomalous position. Yet that clear mind of hers warned her again and again that there was nothing inherently wrong or mean or shameful in the stand which she had taken. The method thereof might come in perhaps for a little censure. But otherwise her harshest critics, if unbiased, could only say that instead of sharing the burdens of her own group she had elected to stray along a path where she personally could find the greatest ease, comfort and expansion. She had long since given up the search for happiness.        But there were moments when a chance discussion about coloured people couched in the peculiarly brutal terms which white America a fleets in the discussion of this problem made her blood boil, and she longed to confound her vis-d-vis and his tacit assumption that she, being presumbably a white woman, would hold the same views as he, with the remark: " I'm one of them, do you find me worthless or dishonest or offensive in any way? " Such a denouement would have, she felt, been a fine gesture. But life she knew had a way of allowing grand gestures to go unremarked and unrewarded. Would it be worth while to throw away the benefits of casual whiteness in America when no great issue was at stake? Would it indeed be worth while to forfeit them when a great issue was involved? Remembering the material age in which she lived and the material nation of which she was a member, she was doubtful. Her mother's old dictum recurred: " Life is more important than colour."    The years slipped by. Virginia seemed in no haste to marry. Anthony whom Angela saw occasionally at the Art School shared apparently in this cool deliberateness. Yet there was nothing in his action or manner to make her feel that he was anticipating a change. Rather, if she judged him correctly he, like herself, tired of the snarl into which the three of them had been drawn, had settled down to a resigned acceptance of fate. If conceivable, he was quieter, more reserved than ever, yet radiating a strange restfulness and the peace which comes from surrender.          In May the prizes for the contest were announced. Angela received the John T. Stewart Prize for her "Fourteenth Street Types"; her extreme satis faction was doubled by the knowledge that the Nehemiah Sloan Prize, of equal value, had been awarded Miss Powell for her picture entitled " A Street in Harlem ". The coloured girl was still difficult and reserved, but under Angela's persistent efforts at friendship her frank and sympathetic interest and comprehension of her class-mate's difficulties, the latter had finally begun to thaw a little. They were not planning to live together in France, their tastes were not sufficiently common for that closeness, but both were looking forward to a year of pleasure, of inspiring work, to a life that would be " different ". Angela was relieved, but Miss Powell was triumphant; not unpleasantly, she gave the impression of having justified not only her calling but herself and, in a lesser degree, her race. The self-consciousness of colour, racial responsibility, lay, Angela had discovered, deep upon her.  The passage money to France was paid. Through the terms offered by the committee of the School for Americans at Fontainebleau, an appreci able saving had been effected. The girls were to sail in June. As the time drew nearer Angela felt herself becoming more and more enthusiastic. She had at first looked upon her sojourn abroad as a heaven-sent break in the montony and diffi culties of her own personal problems, but lately, with the involuntary reaction of youth, she was beginning to recover her sense of embarking on a great adventure. Her spirits mounted steadily.          One evening she went around to Martha Bur den's to discuss the trip; she wanted information about money, clothes, possible tips.  " Everything you can think of, Martha," she said with something of her former vital manner. " This is an old story to you, you've been abroad so many times you ought to write an encyclo paedia on ' What to take to Europe } . I mean to follow your advice blindly and the next time I see Miss Powell I'll pass it along to her."  " No need to," said Martha laconically and sombrely. " She isn't going."  " Not going ! Why she was going two weeks ago."  c Yes, but she's not going this week nor any other week I'm afraid ; at least not through the good offices of the American Committee for the Fon- tainebleau School of Fine Arts. They've returned her passage money. Didn't you know it? I thought everybody had heard of it."  Angela fought against a momentary nausea. " No, I didn't know it. I haven't seen her for ages. I'm so busy getting myself together. Martha, what's it all about? Is it because she's coloured? You don't mean it's because she's coloured? "  " Well, it is. They said they themselves were without prejudice, but that they were sure the enforced contact on the boat would be unpleasant to many of the students, garnered as they would be from all parts of the United States. Further more they couldn't help but think that such con tact would be embarrassing to Miss Powell too. Oh, there's no end to the ridiculous piffle which they've written and said. I've had a little com mittee of students and instructors going about,  r    trying to stir up public sentiment. Mr. Cross has been helping and Paget too. I wish Paulette were here; she'd get. some yellow journal publicity. Van Meier has come out with some biting editorials ; he's shown up a lot of their silly old letters. I shouldn't be surprised but what if we kept at it long enough we'd get somewhere."  She reflected a moment. " Funny thing is we're having such a hard time in making Miss Powell show any fight. I don't understand that girl."  Angela murmured that perhaps she had no hope of making an impression on prejudice. " It's so unreasonable and far-reaching. Maybe she doesn't want to sacrifice her peace of mind for what she considers a futile struggle."  " That's what Mr. Cross said. He's been wonderful to her and an indefatigable worker. Of course you'll be leaving soon since none of this touches you, but come into a committee meeting or two, won't you? We're meeting here. I'll give you a ring."  " Well," said Angela to herself that night after she had regained her room. " I wonder what I ought to do now? " Even yet she was receiving an occasional reporter; the pleasant little stir of publicity attendant on her prize had not yet died away. Suppose she sent for one of them and announced her unwillingness to accept the terms of the American Committee inasmuch as they had withdrawn their aid from Miss Powell. Suppose she should finish calmly: " I, too, am a Negro ". What would happen? The withdrawal of the assistance without which her trip abroad, its hoped for healing, its broadening horizons woulcj        be impossible. Evidently, there was no end to the problems into which this matter of colour could involve one, some of them merely superficial, as in this instance, some of them gravely physical. Her head ached with the futility of trying to find a solution to these interminable puzzles.  As a child she and Jinny had been forbidden to read the five and ten cent literature of their day. But somehow a copy of a mystery story entitled " Who killed Dr. Cronlin? " found its way into their hands, a gruesome story all full of bearded men, hands preserved in alcohol, shadows on window curtains. Shivering with fascination, they had devoured it after midnight or early in the morning while their trusting parents still slumbered. Every page they hoped would disclose the mystery. But their patience went unrewarded for the last sen tence of the last page still read: " Who killed Dr. Cronlin? "  Angela thought of it now, and smiled and sighed. "Just what is or is not ethical in this matter of colour? " she asked herself. And indeed it was a nice question. Study at Fontainebleau would have undoubtedly changed Miss Powell's attitude toward life forever. If she had received the just reward for her painstaking study, she would have reasoned that right does triumph in essentials. Moreover the inspiration might have brought out latent talent, new possibilities. Furthermore, granted that Miss Powell had lost out by a stroke of ill-fortune, did that necessarily call for Angela's loss? If so, to what end?  Unable to answer she fell asleep.  Absorbed in preparations she allowed two weeks to pass by, then, remembering Martha's      invitation, she went again to the Starr household on an evening when the self-appointed committee was expected to meet. She found Anthony, Mr. Paget, Ladislas and Martha present. The last was more perturbed than ever. Indeed an air of sombre discouragement lay over the whole com pany.  " Well," asked the newcomer, determined to appear at ease in spite of Anthony's propinquity, " how are things progressing? "  "Not at all," replied Mr. Paget. "Indeed we're about to give up the whole fight."  Ladislas with a sort of provoked amusement explained then that Miss Powell herself had thrown up the sponge. " She's not only with drawn but she sends us word to-night that while she appreciates the fight we're making she'd rather we'd leave her name out of it."  " Did you ever hear anything to equal that? " snapped Martha crossly. " I wonder if coloured people aren't natural born quitters. Sometimes I think I'll never raise another finger for them."  " You don't know what you're talking about," said Anthony hotly. " If you knew the ceaseless warfare which most coloured people wage, you'd understand that sometimes they have to stop their fight for the trimmings of life in order to hang on to the essentials which they've got to have and for which they must contend too every day just as hard as they did the first day. No, they're not quitters, they've merely learned to let go so they can conserve their strength for another bad day. I'm coloured and I know."  There was a moment's tense silence while the          three white people stared speechless \\ith sur prise. Then Martha said in a still shocked voice: " Coloured ! Why, I can't believe it. Why, you never told us you were coloured."  " Which is precisely why I'm telling you now," said Anthony, coldly rude. " So you won't be making off-hand judgments about us." He started toward the door. " Since the object for which this meeting has been called has become null and void I take it that we are automatically dismissed. Good-night."  Martha hastened after him. " Oh, Mr. Cross, don't go like that. As though it made any differ ence ! Why should this affect our very real regard for each other? "  "Why should it indeed?" he asked a trifle enigmatically. " I'm sure I hope it won't. But I must go." He left the room, Paget and Ladislas both hastening on his heels.  Martha stared helplessly after him. " I suppose I haven't said the right thing. But what could I do? I was so surprised ! " She turned to Angela: " And I really can't get over his being coloured, can you? "  "No," said Angela solemnly, "I can't . . ." and surprised herself and Martha by bursting into a flood of tears.    For some reason the incident steadied her deter mination. Perhaps Anthony was the vicarious sacrifice, she told herself and knew even as she said it that the supposition was pure did not consider that he was making a sacrifice;          his confession or rather his statement with regard to his blood had the significance of the action of a person who clears his room of rubbish. Anthony did not want his mental chamber strewn with the chaff of deception and confusion. He did not label himself, but on the other hand he indulged every now and then in a general house-cleaning because he would not have the actions of his life bemused and befuddled.  As for Angela she asked for nothing better than to put all the problems of colour and their attend ant difficulties behind her. She could not meet those problems in their present form in Europe; literally in every sense she would begin life all over. In France or Italy she would speak of her strain of Negro blood and abide by whatever con sequences such exposition would entail. But the consequences could not engender the pain and difficulties attendant upon them here.  Somewhat diffidently she began to consider the idea of going to see Miss Powell. The horns of her dilemma resolved themselves into an unwillingness to parade her own good fortune before her dis appointed classmate and an equal unwillingness to depart for France, leaving behind only the cold sympathy of words on paper. And, too, some thing stronger, more insistent than the mere consideration of courtesy urged her on. After all, this girl was one of her own. A whim of fate had set their paths far apart but just the same they were more than " sisters under the skin." They were really closely connected in blood, in racial condition, in common suffering. Once again she thought of herself as she had years ago when she had seen the coloured girl refused service in        the restaurant: " It might so easily have been Virginia."  Without announcement then she betook herself up town to Harlem and found herself asking at the door of the girl's apartment if she might see Miss Powell. The mother whom Angela had last seen so proud and happy received her with a note of sullen bafflement which to the white girl's consciousness connoted: " Easy enough for you, all safe and sound, high and dry, to come and sym pathize with my poor child." There was no trace of gratitude or of appreciation of the spirit which had inspired Angela to pay the visit.  To her inquiry Mrs. Powell rejoined: "Yes, I guess you c'n see her. There're three or four other people in there now pesterin' her to death. I guess one mo' won't make no diffunce."  Down a long narrow hall she led her, past two rooms whose dark interiors seemed Stygian in contrast with the bright sunlight which the visitor had just left. But the end of the hall opened into a rather large, light, plain but comfortable dining- room where Miss Powell sat entertaining, to Angela's astonishment, three or four people, all of them white. Her astonishment, however, lessened when she perceived among them John Banky, one of the reporters who had come rather often to interview herself and her plans for France. All of them, she judged angrily, were of his pro fession, hoping to wring their half column out of Miss Powell's disappointment and embarrass ment.  Angela thought she had never seen the girl one half so attractive and exotic. She was wearing a thin silk dress, plainly made but of a flaming red      from which the satin blackness of her neck rose, a straight column topped by her squarish, some what massive head. Her thin, rather flat dark lips brought into sharp contrast the dazzling per fection of her teeth; her high cheek bones showed a touch of red. To anyone whose ideals of beauty were not already set and sharply limited, she must have made a breathtaking appeal. As long as she sat quiescent in her rather sulky reticence she made a marvellous figure of repose ; focussing all the attention of the little assemblage even as her dark skin and hair drew into themselves and re tained the brightness which the sun, streaming through three windows, showered upon her.  As soon as she spoke she lost, however, a little of this perfection. For though a quiet dignity per sisted, there were pain and bewilderment in her voice and the flat sombreness of utter despair. Clearly she did not know how to get rid of the intruders, but she managed to maintain a poise and aloofness which kept them at their distance. Surely, Angela thought, listening to the stupid, almost impertinent questions put, these things can mean nothing to them. But they kept on with their baiting rather as a small boy keeps on tormenting a lonely and dispirited animal at the Zoo.  ' We were having something of an academic discussion with Miss Powell here," said Banky, turning to Angela. " This," he informed his co-workers, " is Miss Mory, one of the prize winners of the Art Exhibit and a classmate of Miss Powell. I believe Miss Powell was to cross with you, as er your room-mate did you say? "  " No," said Angela, flushing a little for Miss Powell, for she thought she understood the double          meaning of the question, " we weren't intending to be room-mates. Though so far as I am con cerned," she heard herself, to her great surprise, saying: " I'd have been very glad to share Miss Powell's state-room if she had been willing." She wanted to get away from this aspect. " What's this about an academic discussion? "  Miss Powell's husky, rather mutinous voice interrupted: "There isn't any discussion, Miss Mory, academic or otherwise. It seems Mr. Paget told these gentlemen and Miss Tilden here, that I had withdrawn definitely from the fight to induce the Committee for the American Art School abroad to allow me to take advantage of their arrangements. So they came up here to get me to make a statement and I said I had none to make other than that I was sick and tired of the whole business and I'd be glad to let it drop."  " And I," said Miss Tilden, a rangy young lady wearing an unbecoming grey dress and a pecu liarly straight and hideous bob, " asked her if she weren't really giving up the matter because in her heart she knew she hadn't a leg to stand on."  Angela felt herself growing hot. Something within her urged caution, but she answered defiantly: " What do you mean she hasn't a leg to stand on? '  " Well, of course, this is awfully plain speaking and I hope Miss Powell won't be offended," resumed Miss Tilden, showing only too plainly that she didn't care whether Miss Powell were offended or not, " but after all we do know that a great many people find the er Negroes objectionable and so of course no self-respecting one of them would go where she wasn't wanted."          Miss Powell's mother hovering indefinitely in the background, addressing no one in particular, opined that she did not know that " that there committee owned the boat. If her daughter could only afford it she'd show them how quickly she'd go where she wanted and not ask no one no favours either."  " Ah, but," said Miss Tilden judicially, " there's the fallacy. Something else is involved here. There's a social side to this matter, inherent if not expressed. And that is the question." She shook a thin bloodless finger at Miss Powell. " Back of most of the efforts which you people make to get into schools and clubs and restaurants and so on, isn't there really this desire for social equality? Come now, Miss Powell, be frank and tell me."  With such sharpness as to draw the attention of everyone in the room Angela said: " Come, Miss Tilden, that's unpardonable and you know it. Miss Powell hadn't a thought in mind about social equality. All she wanted was to get to France and to get there as cheaply as possible."  Banky, talking in a rather affected drawl, con firmed the last speaker. " I think, too, that's a bit too much, Miss Tilden. We've no right to interpret Miss Powell's ideas for her."  A short, red-faced young man intervened: " But just the same isn't that the question involved? Doesn't the whole matter resolve itself into this: Has Miss Powell or any other young coloured woman knowing conditions in America the right to thrust her company on a group of people with whom she could have nothing in common except her art? If she stops to think she must realize          that not one of the prospective group of students who would be accompanying her on that ship would really welcome her presence. Here's Miss Mory, for instance, a fellow student. What more natural under other circumstances than that she should have made arrangements to travel with Miss Powell? She knows she has to share her cabin with some one. But no; such a thought apparently never entered her head. Why? The answer is obvious. Very well then. If she, know ing Miss Powell, feels this way, how much more would it be the feeling of total strangers? "  A sort of shocked silence fell upon the room. It was an impossible situation. How, thought Angela desperately, knowing the two sides, could she ever explain to these smug, complacent people Miss Powell's ambition, her chilly pride, the remoteness with which she had treated her fellow- students, her only too obvious endeavour to share their training and not their friendship? Hastily, almost crudely, she tried to get something of this over, ashamed for herself ashamed for Miss Powell whose anguished gaze begged for her silence.  At last the coloured girl spoke. " It's wonderful of you to take my part in this way, Miss Mory. I had no idea you understood so perfectly. But don't you see there's no use in trying to explain it? It's a thing which one either does see or doesn't see." She left her soft, full, dark gaze rest for a second on her auditors. " I'm afraid it is not in the power of these persons to grasp what you mean."  The stocky young man grew a little redder. " I think we do understand, Miss Powell. All that Miss Mory says simply confirms my first idea. For      otherwise, understanding and sympathizing with you as she does, why has she, for instance, never made any very noticeable attempt to become your friend? Why shouldn't she have asked you to be her side-partner on this trip which I understand you're taking together? There would have been an unanswerable refutation for the committee's arguments. But no, she does nothing even though it means the thwarting for you of a life-time's ambition. Mind, I'm not blaming you, Miss Mory. You are acting in accordance with a natural law. I'm just trying to show Miss Powell here how inevitable the workings of such a law are."  It was foolish reasoning and fallacious, yet con taining enough truth to make it sting. Some icy crust which had formed over Angela's heart shifted, wavered, broke and melted. Suddenly it seemed as though nothing in the world were so important as to allay the poignancy of Miss Powell's situation; for this, she determined quixotically, no price would be too dear. She said icily in tones which she had never heard herself use before: " It's true I've never taken any stand hitherto for Miss Powell for I never thought she needed it. But now that the question has come up I want to say that I'd be perfectly willing to share my state room with her and to give her as much of my company as she could stand. However, that's all out of the question now because Miss Powell isn't going to France on the American Committee Fund and I'm not going either." She stopped a second and added quietly: "And for the same reason."  Someone said in bewilderment: " What do you mean when you say you're not going? And for the same reason? "        " I mean that if Miss Powell isn't wanted, I'm not wanted either. You imply that she's not wanted because she's coloured. Well, I'm coloured too."  One of the men said under his breath, " God, what a scoop ! " and reached for his hat. But Banky, his face set and white, held him back.  " I don't believe you know what you're saying, Miss Mory. But anyway, whether it's true or untrue, for God's sake take it back ! "  His tone of horror added the last touch. Angela laughed in his face. " Take it back ! " She could hardly contain herself. " Do you really think that being coloured is as awful as all that? Can't you see that to my way of thinking it's a great deal better to be coloured and to miss oh scholarships and honours and preferments, than to be the contemptible things which you've all shown yourselves to be this morning? Coming here bait ing this poor girl and her mother, thrusting your self-assurance down their throats, branding yourselves literally dogs in the manger? " She turned to the coloured girl's mother. " Mrs. Powell, you surely don't want these people here any longer. Have I your permission to show them out? " Crossing the room superbly she opened the door. " This way, please, and don't come back any more. You can rest assured we'll find a way to keep you out."  Silently the little line filed out. Only Miss Tilden, laying her hand on Angela's arm paused to say avidly: "You'll let me come to see you, surely? I can give you some fine publicity, only I must have more data. How about an exclusive interview? "        Angela said stonily: " Mrs. Powell will show you the front door." Then she and her former class-mate stood regarding each other. The dark girl crossed the room and caught her hands and kissed them. " Oh," she said, " it was magnificent I never guessed it, but you shouldn't have done it. It's all so unjust, so silly and so tiresome. You, of course, only get it when you bring it upon youreslf. But I'm black and I've had it all my life. You don't know the prizes within my grasp that have been snatched away from me again because of colour." She turned as her mother entered the room. " Mother, wasn't she magnificent? "  " She was a fool," Mrs. Powell replied shortly.  Her words brought the exalted Angela back to earth. " Yes," she said, smiling whimsically, " I am just that, a fool. I don't know what possessed me. I'm poor, I was in distress; I wanted a new deal. Now I don't know which way to turn for it. That story will be all over New York by to-morrow morning." She burst out laughing. " Think of my choosing four reporters before whom to make my great confession ! " Her hand sought Miss Powell's. " Good-bye, both of you. Don't worry about me. I never dreamed that anything like this could happen, but the mere fact that is has shows that the truth was likely to come out any day. So don't blame yourselves for it. Good bye."    Banky was waiting for her in the vestibule down stairs. " I'm so sorry about the whole damned business, Miss Mory," he said decently. " It's          a damned shame. If there's anything I can do -- "  Rather shortly she said there was nothing. " And you don't need to worry. As I told you upstairs, being coloured isn't as awful as all that. I'll get along." Ignoring his hand she passed by him into the street. It was Saturday afternoon so there was a chance of her finding Jinny at home.  " And if she isn't there I can wait," she told herself, and thanked God in her heart for the stability implied in sisterhood.  Jinny was home, mulling happily over the small affairs which kept her a little girl. Her sister, looking at the serene loveliness of her face, said irrelevantly: "You make me feel like an old woman."  " Well," replied Jinny, " you certainly have the art of concealing time's ravages, for you not only look young but you have the manner of someone who's just found a million dollars. Come in and tell me about it."  " Found a million dollars ! H'm, lost it I should say ! " But a sudden wave of relief and contentment broke over her. " Oh, Jinny, tell me, have I been an utter fool ! I've thrown away every chance I've ever had in the world, just for a whim." Suddenly close in the full tide of sisterliness, they sat facing each other on the com fortable couch while Angela told her story. " I hadn't the faintest idea in the world of telling it. I was thinking only the other day how lucky I was compared to Miss Powell, and the first thing I knew there it all came tripping off my tongue. But I had to do it. If you could just have seen          those pigs of reporters and Miss Powell's face under their relentless probing. And old Mrs. Powell, helpless and grunting and sweating and thinking me a fool; she told me so, you know. . . . Why, Jinny, darling, you're not ever cry ing ! Darling, there's nothing to cry about; what's the matter, Honey ! "  " It's because you are a fool that I am crying," said Jinny sobbing and sniffling, her fingers in her eyes. " You're a fool and the darlingest girl that ever lived, and my own precious, lovely, wonder ful sister back again. Oh, Angela, I'm so happy. Tell them to send you your passage money back; say you don't want anything from them that they don't want to give; let them go, let them all go except the ones who like you for yourself. And dearest, if you don't mind having to skimp a bit for a year or two and not spreading yourself as you planned, we'll get you off to Europe after all. You know I've got all my money from the house. I've never touched it. You can have as much of that as you want and pay me back later or not at all."  Laughing and crying, Angela told her that she couldn't think of it. " Keep your money for your marriage, Jinny. It'll be some time before Anthony will make any real money, I imagine. But I will take your advice and go to Europe after all. All this stuff will be in the paper to-morrow, I suppose, so I'll write the American Committee people to-night. As for the prize money, if they want that back they can have it. But I don't think they will; nothing was said about Miss Powell's. That's a thousand dollars. I'll take that and go to Paris and live as long as I can. If        I can't have the thousand I'll use the few hundreds that I have left and go anyway. And when I come back I'll go back to my old job or go into the schools. But all that's a long way off and we don't know what might turn up."  There were one or two matters for immediate consideration. The encounter with the reporters had left Angela a little more shaken than was at first apparent. " I don't want to run into them again," she said ruefully. Her lease on the little apartment in Jayne Street had still a month to run. She would go down this very evening, get together her things, and return to Jinny, with whom she would live quietly until it was time for her to sail. Her mail she could leave with the janitor to be called for. Fortunately the furniture was not hers ; there were only a few pictures to be removed. After all, she had very few friends to consider, just the Sandburgs, Martha Burden, Mrs. Denver, Ralph Ashley and Rachel Salting.  " And I don't know what to do about them," she said, pondering. " After all, you can't write to people and say: c Dear friend: You've always thought I was white. But I'm not really. I'm coloured and I'm going back to my own folks to live.' Now can you? Oh, Jinny, Jinny, isn't it a great old world? "  In the end, after the story appeared, as it assuredly did, in the next morning's paper, she cut out and sent to each of her former friends copies of Miss Tilden's story whose headlines read: " Socially Ambitious Negress Confesses to Long Hoax."            With the exception of Banky's all the accounts took the unkindest attitude possible. The young Hungarian played up the element of self-sacrifice and the theory that blood after all was thicker than water. Angela guessed rightly that if he could have he would have preferred omitting it, and that he had only written it up to offset as far as possible the other accounts. Of the three other meanly insinuating stories Miss Tilden's was the silliest and most dangerous. She spoke of mixed blood as the curse of the country, a curse whose " insidiously concealed influence constantly threatens the wells of national race purity. Such incidents as these make one halt before he con demns the efforts of the Ku Klux Klan and its unceasing fight for  per cent. Americanism."  The immediate effect of this publicity was one which neither of the sisters had foreseen. When Angela reported for work on the following Monday morning she found a note on her desk asking her immediate appearance in the office. The president returning her good-morning with scant courtesy, showed her a clipping and asked if she were the Miss Mory of the story. Upon her assurance that she was none other, he handed her a month's salary in lieu of notice and asked her to con sider her connection with the firm at an end.  " We have no place for deceit in an institution such as this," he said augustly.  The incident shook both girls to a degree. Vir ginia particularly was rendered breathless by its cruel immediacy. Never before had she come so close to the special variation of prejudice mani fested to people in Angela's position. That the president of the concern should attribute the          girl's reticence on this subject to deceit seemed to her the last ounce of injustice. Angela herself was far less perturbed.  " I've seen too much of this sort of thing to feel it as you do, Virginia. Of course, as you see, there are all kinds of absurdities involved. In your case, showing colour as you do, you'd have been refused the job at the very outset. Perhaps they would have said that they had found coloured people incompetent or that other girls had a strong natural aversion toward working beside one of us. Now here I land the position, hold it long enough to prove ability and the girls work beside me and remain untainted. So evidently there's no blind inherent disgust to be overcome. Looking just the same as I've ever looked I let the fact of my Negro ancestry be known. Mind, I haven't changed the least bit, but immediately there's all this hold ing up of hands and the cry of deceit is raised. Some logic, that! It really would be awfully funny, you see, Jinny, if it couldn't be fraught with such disastrous consequences for people like, say, Miss Powell."  " Don't mention her," said Jinnv vehemently. " If it hadn't been for her you wouldn't have been in all this trouble."  Angela smiled. " If it hadn't been for her, you and I probably never would have really found each other again. But you mustn't blame her. Sooner or later I'd have been admitting, fessing ', as the papers say, my black blood. Not that I myself think it of such tremendous import ance; in spite of my efforts to break away I really don't, Virginia. But because this country of ours makes it so important, against my own conviction          I was beginning to feel as though I were laden down with a great secret. Yet when I begin to delve into it, the matter of blood seems nothing compared with individuality, character, living. The truth of the matter is, the whole business was just making me fagged to death."  She sat lost intently in thought. " All of the complications of these last few years, and you can't guess what complications there have been, darling child, have been based on this business of ' passing '. I understand why Miss Powell gave up the uneven fight about her passage. Of course, in a way it would have been a fine thing if she could have held on, but she was perfectly justified in letting go so she could avoid still greater bitter ness and disappointment and so she could have something left in her to devote to her art. You can't fight and create at the same time. And I understand, too, why your Anthony bestirs him self every little while and makes his confession; simply so he won't have to be bothered with the trappings of pretence and watchfulness. I sup pose he told you about that night down at Martha Burden's? "  " Yes," said Jinny, sighing, " he has terrible ideals. There's something awfully lofty about Anthony. I wish he were more like Matthew, comfortable and homey. Matt's got some ideals, too, but he doesn't work them overtime. Anthony's a darling, two darlings, but he's awfully, awfully what-do-you-call-it, ascetic. I shouldn't be at all surprised but what he had a secret canker eating at his heart."  Angela said rather sternly, " Look here, Jinny, I don't believe you love him after all, do you? "      " Well now, when I get right down to it some times I think I do. Sometimes I think I don't. Of course the truth of the matter is, I'd hardly have thought about Anthony or marriage either just now, if I hadn't been so darn lonely. You know I'm not like you, Angela. When we were children I was the one who was going to have a career, and you were always going to have a good time. Actually it's the other way round; you're the one who's bound to have a career. You just gravitate to adventure. There's something so forceful and so strong about you that you can't keep out of the battle. But, Angela, I want a home, with you if you could just stand still long enough, or failing that, a home with husband and children and all that goes with it. Of course I don't mind admitting that at any time I'd have given up even you for Matthew. But next to being his wife I'd rather live with you, and next to that I'd like to marry Anthony. I don't like to be alone; for though I can fend for myself I don't want to."  Angela felt herself paling with the necessity of hiding her emotion. " So poor Anthony's only third in your life? "  " Yes, I'm afraid he is . . . Darling, what do you say to scallops for dinner? I feel like cooking to-day. Guess I'll hie me to market."  She left the room, and her sister turned to the large photograph of Cross which Virginia kept on the mantel. She put her fingers on the slight youthful hollows of his pictured cheeks, touched his pictured brow. " Oh Anthony, Anthony, is Life cheating you again? You'll always be first in my life, dearest."          Perhaps Virginia's diagnosis of her character was correct. At any rate she welcomed the present combination of difficulties through which she was now passing. Otherwise this last confession of Jinny's would have plunged her into fresh un- happiness. But she had many adjustments to make and to face. First of all there was her new status in the tiny circle in which she had moved. When at the end of two weeks she went down to her old apartment in Jayne Street to ask for her mail, she was, in spite of herself amazed and hurt to discover a chilled bewilderment, an aloofness, in the manner of Mrs. Denver, with whom she had a brief encounter. On the other hand there were a note and a calling card from Martha Burden, and some half dozen letters from Elizabeth and Walter Sandburg.  Martha's note ran: " Undoubtedly you and Mr. Cross are very fine people. But I don't believe I could stand another such shock very soon. Of course it was magnificent of you to act as you did. But oh, my dear, how quixotic. And after all a quoi bon? Will you come to see me as soon as you get this, or send me word how I may see you? And Angele, if you let all this nonsense interfere with your going to Europe I'll never forgive you. Ladislas and I have several thousand dollars stored away just begging to be put out at interest."  Elizabeth Sandburg said nothing about the matter, but Angela was able to read her know ledge between the lines. The kind-hearted couple could not sufficiently urge upon her their un changing regard and friendship. " Why on earth don't you come and see us? " Elizabeth queried in her immense, wandering chirography, five words      to a page. " You can't imagine how we miss you. Walter's actually getting off his feed. Do take a moment from whatever masterpiece you're com posing and give us a week-end."  But from Rachel Salting and from Ashley not one single word !          MORE than ever her determination to sail became fixed. " Some people," she said to Jinny, " might think it the thing to stay here and fight things out. Martha, for instance, is keenly disappointed because I won't let the committee which had been working for Miss Powell take up my case. I sus pect she thinks we're all quitters. But I know when I've had enough. I told her I wanted to spend my life doing something besides fighting. Moreover, the Committee, like myself, is pretty sick of the whole afiair, though not for the same reason, and I think there'd be even less chance for a readjustment in my case than there was in Miss Powell's."  An interview with Clarke Otter, Chairman of the Advisory Board of the American Committee, had given her this impression. Mr. Otter's attitude betokened a curious admixture of re sentment at what he seemed to consider her deceit in " passing " and exasperation at her having been quixotic enough to give the show away. " We think you are quite right in express ing your determination not to take advantage of the Committee's arrangements. It evidences a delicacy of feeling quite unusual in the circum stances." Angela was boiling with anger when she left.          A letter to the donor of the prize brought back the laconic answer that the writer was interested " not in Ethnology but in Art."  " I'd like to see that party," said Angela, revert ing to the jargon of her youth. " I'll bet he's nowhere near as stodgy as he sounds. I shouldn't wonder but what he was just bubbling over with mirth at the silliness of it all."  Certainly she herself was bubbling over with mirth or with what served for that quality. Virginia could not remember ever having seen her in such high spirits, not since the days when they used to serve Monday's dinner for their mother and play at the roles in which Mrs. Henrietta Jones had figured so largely. But Angela herself knew the shallowness of that mirth whose reality, Anthony, unable to remain for any length of time in her presence and yet somehow unable to stay away, some times suspected.  Her savings, alas ! including the prize money, amounted roughly to , dollars. Anthony had urged her to make the passage second class on one of the large, comfortable boats. Then, if she proved herself a good sailor, she might come back third class.  " And anyway don't put by any more than enough for that," said Jinny maternally, " and if you need any extra money write to me and I'll send you all you want."  From stories told by former foreign students who had sometimes visited the Union it seemed as though she might stretch her remaining hundreds over a period of eight or nine months. " And by that time I'll have learned enough to know whether      I'm to be an honest-to-God artist or a plain draw ing teacher."  " I almost hope it will be the latter," said Jinny with a touching selfishness, " so you'll have to come back and live with us. Don't you hope so, Anthony? "  Angela could see him wince under the strain of her sister's artlessness. " Eight or nine months abroad ought to make a great difference in her life," he said with no particular relevance. " In deed in the lives of all of us." Both he and Angela had only one thought these days, that the time for departure would have to arrive. Neither of them had envisaged the awfulness of this pull on their self-control.    Now there were only five days before her departure on Monday. She divided them among the Sandburgs, Anthony and Jinny who was coming down with a summer cold. On Saturday the thought came to her that she would like to see Philadelphia again; it was a thought so per sistent that by nine o'clock she was in the train and by . sne was preparing for bed in a small side-room in the Hotel Walton in the city of her birth. Smiling, she fell asleep vaguely soothed by the thought of being so close to all that had been once the scene of her steady, un checked life.  The propinquity was to shake her more than she could dream.  In the morning she breakfasted in her room, then coming downstairs stood in the portico of        the hotel drawing on her gloves as she had done so many years before when she had been a girl shopping with her mother. A flood of memories rushed over her, among them the memory of that day when her father and Virginia had passed them on the street and they had not spoken. How trivial the reason for not speaking seemed now! In later years she had cut Jinny for a reason equally trivial.  She walked up toward Sixteenth Street. It was Sunday and the beautiful melancholy of the day was settling on the quiet city. There was a freshness and a solemnity in the air as though even the atmosphere had been rarified and soothed. A sense of loneliness invaded her; this was the city of her birth, of her childhood and of most of her life. Yet there was no one, she felt, to whom she could turn this beautiful day for a welcome; old acquaintances might be mildly pleased, faintly curious at seeing her, but none of them would show any heart-warming gladness. She had left them so abruptly, so completely. Weil, she must not think on these things. After all, in New York she had been lonely too.  The Sixteenth Street car set her down at Jefler- son Street and slowly she traversed the three long blocks. Always quiet, always respectable, they were doubly so in the sanctity of Sunday morning. What a terrible day Sunday could be without friends, ties, home, family. Only five years ago, less than five years, she had had all the simple, stable fixtures of family life, the appetizing break fast, the music, the church with its interesting, paintable types, long afternoons and evenings with visitors and discussions beating in the void.          And Matthew Henson, would he, she wondered, give her welcome? But she thought that still she did not want to see him. She was not happy, but she was not through adventuring, through tasting life. And she knew that a life spent with Matthew Henson would mean a cessation of that. After all, was he, with his steadiness, his upright ness, his gift for responsibility any happier than she? She doubted it.  Oh, she hoped Sundays in Paris would be gay!  Opal Street came into her vision, a line, a mere shadow of a street falling upon the steadfastness of Jefferson. Her heart quickened, tears came into her eyes as she turned that corner which she had turned so often, that corner which she had once left behind her forever in order to taste and know life. In the hot July sun the street lay almost deserted. A young coloured man, im maculate in white shirt sleeves, slim and straight, bending in his doorway to pick up the bulky Sunday paper, straightened up to watch her advancing toward him. Just this side of him stood her former home, how tiny it was and yet how full of secrets, of knowledge of joy, despair, suffer ing, futility in brief Life! She stood a few moments in front of it, just gazing, but presently she went up and put her hand on the red brick, wondering blindly if in some way the insensate thing might not communicate with her through touch. A coloured woman sitting in the window watching her rather sharply, came out then and asked her suspiciously what she wanted.  " Nothing," Angela replied dully. " I just wanted to look at the house."        " It isn't for sale, you know."  " No, no, of course not. I just wanted to look at it again. I used to live here, you see. I  wondered " Even if she did get permission  to go inside, could she endure it? If she could just stand once in that little back room and cry and cry perhaps her tears would flood away all that mass of regret and confusion and futile mem ories, and she could begin life all over with a blank page. Thank God she was young! Suddenly it seemed to her that entering the house once more, standing in that room would be a complete panacea. Raising her eyes expectantly to the woman's face she began: " Would you be so kind ? "  But the woman, throwing her a last suspicious look and muttering that she was " nothing with poor white trash," turned and, slamming the door behind her, entered the little square parlour and pulled down the blinds.    The slim young man came running down the street toward her. Closer inspection revealed his ownership of a pleasant brown freckled face topped by thick, soft, rather closely cropped dark-red hair.  " Angela," he said timidly, and then with more assurance: " It is Angela Murray."  She turned her stricken face toward him. " She wouldn't let me in, Matthew. I'm going to France to-morrow and I thought I'd like to see the old house. But she wouldn't let me look at it. She called me," her voice broke with the injustice of it, " poor white trash."        "I know," he nodded gravely. "She'd do that kind of thing; she doesn't understand, you see." He was leading her gently toward his house. " I think you'd better come inside and rest a moment. My father and mother have gone off for their annual trip to Bridgeton; mother was born there, you know. But you won't mind com ing into the house of an old and tried friend."  " No," she said, conscious of an overwhelming fatigue and general sense of let-downness, " I should say I wouldn't." As they crossed the thresh old she tried faintly to smile but the effort was too much for her and she burst into a flood of choking, strangling, noisy tears.  Matthew removed her hat and fanned her; brought her ice-water and a large soft handkerchief to replace her own sodden wisp. Through her tears she smiled at him, understanding as she did so, the reason for Virginia's insistence on his general niceness. He was still Matthew Henson, still freckled and brown, still capped with that thatch of thick bad hair. But care and hair-dressings and improved toilet methods and above all the emana tion of a fine and generous spirit had metamor phosed him into someone still the old Matthew Henson and yet someone somehow translated into a quintessence of kindliness and gravity and comprehending.  She drank the water gratefully, took out her powder puff.  " I don't need to ask you how you are," he said, uttering a prayer of thanks for averted hysterics. " When a lady begins to powder her nose, she's bucking up all right. Want to tell me all about it?"          " There's nothing to tell. Only I wanted to see the house and suddenly found myself unexpectedly homesick, lonely, misunderstood. And when that woman refused me so cruelly, it was just too much." Her gaze wavered, her eyes filled again.  " Oh," he said in terror, " for God's sake don't cry again! I'll go over and give her a piece of my mind; I'll make her turn the whole house over to you. I'll bring you her head on a charger. Only handkerchief and dried them himself very, very gently.  She caught his hand. " Matthew, you're a dear."  He shrugged negligently, " You haven't always thought that."  This turn of affairs would never do. " What were you planning to do when I barged in? Getting ready to read your paper and be all homey and comfortable? "  " Yes, but I don't want to do that now. Tell you what, Angela, Let's have a lark. Suppose we have dinner here? you get it- Remember how it used to make me happy as a king in the old days if you'd just hand me a glass of water? You said you were sailing to-morrow; you must be all packed. What time do you have to be back? I'll put you on the train."  The idea enchanted her. " I'd love it ! Matthew, what fun ! " They found an apron of his mother's, and in the ice-box, cold roast beef, lettuce which Philadelphians call salad, beets and corn. " I'll make muffins," said Angela joyously, " and you take a dish after dinner and go out and get some ice-cream. Oh, Matthew, how it's all    coming back to me! Do you still shop up here in the market? "  They ate the meal in the little dark cool dining-room, the counterpart of the dining- room in Junius Murray's one-time house across the way. But somehow its smallness was no longer irksome; rather it seemed a tiny island of protection reared out of and against an en croaching sea of troubles. In fancy she saw her father and mother almost a quarter of a century ago coming proudly to such a home, their little redoubt of refuge against the world. How beau tiful such a life could be, shared with some one beloved, with Anthony! Involuntarily she sighed.  Matthew studying her thoughtfully said: " You're dreaming, Angela. Tell me what it's all about."  " I was thinking what a little haven a house like this could be; what it must have meant to my mother. Funny how I almost pounded down the walls once upon a time trying to get away. Now I can't think of anything more marvellous than having such a place as this, here, there, anywhere, to return to."  Startled, he told her of his surprise at hearing such words from her. " If Virginia had said them I should think it perfectly natural; but I hadn't thought of you as being interested in home. How, by the way, is Virginia? "  " Perfect."  With a wistfulness which barely registered with her absorption, he queried: "I suppose she's tre mendously happy? "  " Happy enough."      "A great girl, little Virginia." In his turn he fell to musing, roused himself. " You haven't told me of your adventures and your flight into the great world."  " There's not much to tell, Matthew. All I've seen and experienced has been the common fate of most people, a little sharpened, perhaps, a little vivified. Briefly, I've had a lot of fun and a measure of trouble. I've been stimulated by adventure; I've known suffering and love and pain."  " You're still surprising me. I didn't suppose a girl like you could know the meaning of pain." He gave her a twisted smile. ; Though you cer tainly know how to cause it. Even yet I can get a pang which no other thought produces if I let my mind go back to those first few desperate days after you left me. Heavens, can't you suffer when you're young ! "  She nodded, laid her hand on his. ;c Ter ribly. Remember, I was suffering too, Matthew, though for different causes. I was so pushed, so goaded . . . well, we won't talk about that any more. ... I hope you've got over all that feeling. Indeed, indeed I wasn't worth it. Do tell me you haven't let it harass you all these years."  His hand clasped hers lightly, then withdrew. " No I haven't. . . . The suddenness, the in- evitableness of your departure checked me, pulled me up short. I suffered, oh damnably, but it was suffering with my eyes open. I knew then you weren't for me; that fundamentally we were too far apart. And eventually I got over it. Those days ! " He smiled again wryly, recalling a  A A    memory. " But I went on suffering just the same, only in another way. I fell in love with Jinny."  Her heart in her breast stopped beating. " Mat thew, you didn't ! Why on earth didn't you ever say so? "  " I couldn't. She was such a child, you see; she made it so plain all the time that she looked on me as her sister's beau and therefore a kind of dependable brother. After you went I used to go to see her, take her about. Why she'd swing on my arm and hold up her face for a good-night kiss ! Once, I remember, we had been out and she became car-sick, poor little weak thing ! She was so ashamed ! Like a baby, you know, playing at being grown-up and then ashamed for reverting to babyhood. I went to see her the next day and she was so little and frail and confiding ! I stayed away then for a long time and the next thing I knew she was going to New York. I misjudged you awfully then, Angela. You must forgive me. I thought you had pulled her away. I learned later that I was wrong, that you and she rarely saw each other in New York. Do you know why she left? "  There was her sister's pride to shield but her own need to succour; who could have dreamed of such a dilemma? " I can't betray Jinny," she said to herself and told him that while she per sonally had not influenced her sister the latter had had a very good reason for leaving Phila delphia.  " I suppose so. Certainly she left. But she'd write me ? occasionally, letters just like her dear          self, so frank and girlish and ingenuous and making it so damnably plain that any demonstration of love on my part was out of the question. I said to myself: 'I'm not going to wreck my whole life over those Murray girls '. And I let our friend ship drift off into a nothingness. . . . Then she came to visit Edna Brown this summer. I fairly leaped out to Merion to see her. The moment I laid eyes on her I realized that she had developed, had become a woman. She was as always, kind and sweet, prettier, more alluring than ever. I thought I'd try my luck .... and Edna told me she was engaged. What's the fellow like, Angela? "  " Very nice, very fine."  " Wild about her, I suppose?"  Desperately she looked at him. "He's a rather undemonstrative sort. I suppose he's wild enough. Only, well they talk as though they had no intention of marrying for years and years and they both seem perfectly content with that arrange ment."  He frowned incredulously. " What ! If I thought they weren't in earnest ! "  Impulsively she broke out: " Oh, Matthew, don't you know, there's so much pain, such suffering in the world, a man should never leave any stone unturned to achieve his ultimate happi ness. Why don't you write to Jinny, go to New York to see her? "  Under his freckles his brown skin paled. e You think there's a chance? "  " My dear, I wouldn't dare say. I know she likes you very, very much. And I don't think she regards you as a brother."  '        " Angela, you wouldn't fool me? "  " Why should I do that? And remember after all I'm giving you no assurance. I'm merely saying it's worth taking a chance. Now let's see, we'll straighten up this place and then we must fly."  At the station she kissed him good-bye. " Anyway you're always a brother to me. Think of what I've told you, Matthew; act on it."  " I shall. Oh, Angela, suppose it should be that God sent you down here to-day? "  " Perhaps He did." They parted solemnly.  Three hours later found her entering her sister's apartment. Jinny, her cold raging, her eyes in flamed and weeping, greeted her plaintively. " Look at me, Angela. And you leaving to morrow! I'll never be able to make that boat!" The telephone rang. " It's been ringing steadily for the last hour, somebody calling for you. Do answer it."  The message was from Ashley. He had been away in New Orleans. " And I came back and found that clipping. I knew you sent it. Girl, the way I've pursued you this day ! Finally I caught up with Martha Burden, she told me where you were staying. May I come up? Be there in half an hour."  " Not to-night, Ralph. Would you like to come to the boat to-morrow? "  "So you're going anyhow? Bully! But not before I've seen you ! Suppose I take you to the boat? "  " Awfully nice of you, but I'm going with my sister."          Here Jinny in a voice full of misplaced con sonants told her she was going to do nothing of the sort. " With this cold ! "  Angela spoke into the receiver again. " My sister says she isn't going, so I will fall back on you if I may." She hung up.  Virginia wanted to hear of the trip. The two sisters sat talking far into the night, but Angela said no word about Matthew.    Monday was a day of surprises. Martha and Ladislas Starr, unable to be on hand for the sailing of the boat, came up to the house to drive down town with the departing traveller. Secretly Angela was delighted with this arrangement, but it brought a scowl to Ashley's face.  Virginia, miserable with the wretchedness attend ant on a summer cold, bore up bravely. " I don't mind letting you go like this from the house; but I couldn't stand the ship ! Angela, you're not to worry about me one bit. Only come back to me, happy. I know you will. Oh how different this is from that parting years ago in Philadelphia ! "  " Yes," said Angela soberly. " Then I was to be physically ninety miles away from you, but we were really seas apart. Now darling, three thousand miles are nothing when there is love and trust and understanding. And Jinny, listen ! Life is full of surprises. If a chance for real happiness comes your way don't be afraid to grasp at it."  " Cryptic," wheezed Jinny, laughing. " I don't know what you're talking about, but I'll do my          best to land any happiness that comes drifting toward me." They kissed each other gravely, almost coldly, without tears. But neither could trust herself to say the actual good-bye.  Angela was silent almost all the way down to the dock, answering her friends only in mono syllables. There, another surprise awaited her in the shape of Mrs. Denver, who remained, how ever, only for a few moments. " I couldn't stand having you go," she said pitifully, " without seeing you for one last time." And, folding the girl in a close embrace, she broke down and murmured sadly of a lost daughter who would have been " perhaps like you, dear, had she lived."  Elizabeth Sandburg, the gay, the complacent, the beloved of life, clung to her, weeping, " I can't bear to lose you, Angele." Walter put his arm about her. " Kiss me, old girl. And mind, if you need anything, anything, you're to call on us. If you get sick we'll come over after you, am I right, Lizzie? "  " Yes, of course, of course . . . and don't call me Lizzie. . . . Come away, can't you, and leave them a moment together. Don't you see Ashley glaring at you? "  They withdrew to a good point of vantage on the dock.  Angela, surprised and weeping, remembering both Mrs. Denver's words and the manifestations of kindness in her stateroom said: "They really did love me after all, didn't they? "  " Yes," said Ashley earnestly, " we all love you. I'm coming over to see you by and by, Angele, may I? You know we've a lot of things        to talk about, some things which you perhaps think mean a great deal to me but which in reality mean nothing. Then on the other hand there are some matters which actually do mean something to me but whose value to you I'm not sure of."  " Oh," she said, wiping her eyes and remem bering her former secret. " You aren't coming over to ask me to marry you, are you? You don't have to do that. And anyway ' it is not now as it hath been before '. There's no longer a mystery about me, you know. So the real attraction's gone. Remember, I'm not expecting a thing of you, so please, please don't ask it. Ralph, I can't placard myself, and I suppose there will be lots of times when in spite of myself I'll be passing '. But I want you to know that from now on, so far as sides are concerned, I am on the coloured side. And I don't want you to come over on that side." She shook her head finally. " Too many compli cations even for you."  For though she knew he believed in his brave words, she was too sadly experienced to ask an American to put them to the test.  " All right," he said, smiling at her naive assumptions. " I won't ask you to marry me, at least not yet. But I'm coming over just the same. I don't suppose you've got a lien on Paris."  " Of course I haven't," she giggled a little. " You know perfectly well I want you to come." Her face suddenly became grave. " But if you do come you won't come to make love without meaning anything either, will you? I'd hate that between you and me."        " No," he said gently, instantly comprehending. " I won't do that either."  " You'll come as a friend? "  "Yes, as a friend."  A deck hand came up then and said civilly that in a few minutes they would be casting off and all visitors must go ashore.      AMONG her steamer-letters was a brief note from Anthony :  " Angela, my angel, my dear girl, good-bye. These last few weeks have been heaven and hell. I couldn't bear to see you go, so I've taken my self off for a few hours . . . don't think I'll neglect Jinny. I'll never do that. Am I right in supposing that you still care a little? Oh Angela, try to forget me, but don't do it! I shall never forget you ! "  There were letters and flowers from the Burdens, gifts of all sorts from Ashley and Mrs. Denver, a set of notes for each day out from Virginia. She read letters, examined her gifts and laid them aside. But all day long Anthony's note reposed on her heart; it lay at night beneath her head.    Paris at first charmed and wooed her. For a while it seemed to her that her old sense of joy in living for living's sake had returned to her. It was like those first few days which she had spent in exploring New York. She rode delightedly in the motor-buses on and on to the unknown, un predictable terminus; she followed the winding Seine; crossing and re-crossing the bridges each          with its distinctive characteristics. Back of the Pantheon, near the church of St. Genevieve she discovered a Russian restaurant where strange, exotic dishes were served by tall blond waiters in white, stiff Russian blouses. One day, wandering up the Boulevard du Mont Parnasse, she found at its juncture with the Boulevard Raspail the Cafe Dome, a student restaurant of which many returned students had spoken in the Art School in New York. On entering she was recognized almost immediately by Edith Martin, a girl who had studied with her in Philadelphia.  Miss Martin had lived in Paris two years; knew all the gossip and the characters of the Quarter; could give Angela points on pensions, cafes, tips and the Gallic disposition. On all these topics she poured out perpetually a flood of information, presented her friends, summoned the new comer constantly to her studio or camped uninvited in the other girl's tiny quarters at the Pension Franciana. There was no chance for actual physical loneliness, yet Angela thought after a few weeks of persistent comradeship that she had never felt so lonely in her life. For the first time in her adventuresome existence she was caught up in a tide of homesickness.  Then this passed too with the summer, and she found herself by the end of September engrossed in her work. She went to the Academy twice a day, immersed herself in the atmosphere of the Louvre and the gallery of the Luxembourg. It was hard work, but gradually she schooled herself to remember that this was her life, and that her aim, her one ambition, was to become an acknow ledged, a significant painter of portraits. The      instructor, renowned son of a still more renowned father, almost invariably praised her efforts.  With the coming of the fall the sense of adven ture left her. Paris, so beautiful in the summer, so gay with its thronging thousands, its hosts bent on pleasure, took on another garb in the sullen greyness of late autumn. The tourists disappeared and the hard steady grind of labour, the intent application to the business of living, so noticeable in the French, took the place of a transient, careless freedom. Angela felt herself falling into line; but it was good discipline as she herself realized. Once or twice, in periods of utter loneliness or boredom, she let her mind dwell on her curiously thwarted and twisted life. But the ability for self- pity had vanished. She had known too many others whose lives lay equally remote from goals which had at first seemed so certain. For a period she had watched feverishly for the incoming of foreign mail, sure that some word must come from Virginia about Matthew, but the months crept sullenly by and Jinny's letters remained the same artless missives prattling of school-work, Anthony, Sara Penton, the Movies and visits to Maude the inimitable.  " Of course not everything can come right," she told herself. Matthew evidently had, on second thought, deemed it wisest to consult the evidence of his own senses rather than be guided by the hints which in the nature of things she could offer only vaguely.  Within those six months she lost forever the blind optimism of youth. She did not write Anthony nor did she hear from him.            Christmas Eve day dawned or rather drifted greyly into the beholder's perception out of the black mistiness of the murky night. In spite of her self her spirits sank steadily. Virginia had promised her a present, " I've looked all over this whole town," she wrote, " to find you something good enough, something absolutely perfect. Anthony's been helping me. And at last I've found it. We've taken every possible precaution against the inter ference of wind or rain or weather, and unless something absolutely unpredictable intervenes, it will be there for you Christmas Eve or possibly the day before. But remember, don't open it until Christmas."  But it was now six o'clock on Christmas Eve and no present had come, no letter, no remem brance of any kind. " Oh," she said to herself, " what a fool I was to come so far away from home ! " For a moment she envisaged the possi bility of throwing herself on the bed and sobbing her heart out. Instead she remembered Edith Martin's invitation to make a night of it over at her place, a night which was to include dancing and chaffing, a trip just before midnight to hear Mass at St. Sulpice, and a return to the studio for doubt less more dancing and jesting and laughter, and possibly drunkenness on the part of the American male.  At ten o'clock as she stood in her tiny room rather sullenly putting the last touches to her costume, the maid, Heloise, brought her a cable. It was a long message from Ashley wishing her health, happiness and offering to come over at a week's notice. Somehow the bit of blue paper cheered her, easing her taut nerves.          " Of course they're thinking about me. I'll hear from Jinny any moment; it's not her fault that the delivery is late. I wonder what she sent me."  Returning at three o'clock Christmas morning from the party she put her hand cautiously in the door to switch on the light for fear that a package lay near the threshold, but there was no package there. " Well, even if it were there I couldn't open it," she murmured, " for I'm too sleepy." And indeed she had drugged herself with dancing and gaiety into an overwhelming drowsiness. Barely able to toss aside her pretty dress, she tumbled luxuriously into bed, grateful in the midst of her somnolence for the fatigue which would make her forget. ... In what seemed to her less than an hour, she heard a tremendous knocking at the door.  " Entrez" she called sleepily and relapsed immediately into slumber. The door, as it hap pened, was unlocked; she had been too fatigued to think of it the night before. Heloise stuck in a tousled head. " My God," she told the cook afterwards, " such a time as I had to wake her! There she was asleep on both ears and the gentle man downstairs waiting ! "  Angela finally opened bewildered eyes. " A gentleman," reiterated Heloise in her staccato tongue. " He awaits you below. He says he has a present which he must put into your own hands. Will Mademoiselle then descend or shall I tell him to come back? "  ;{ Tell him to come back," she murmured, then opened her heavy eyes. "Is it really Christmas, Heloise? Where is the gentleman? "    " As though I had him there in my pocket," said Heloise later in her faithful report to the cook.  But finally the message penetrated. Grasping a robe and slippers, she half leaped, half fell down the little staircase and plunged into the five foot square drawing-room. Anthony sitting on the tremendously disproportionate tan and maroon sofa rose to meet her.  His eyes on her astonished countenance, he began searching about in his pockets, slapping his vest, pulling out keys and handkerchiefs. " There ought to be a tag on me somewhere," he remarked apologetically, " but anyhow Virginia and Matthew sent me with their love."
Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider Kelly's star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn's distaste for boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was middleweight boxing champion.I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly. Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had become of him.Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children, lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he had to give it up.By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand. Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated, and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert's mother had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month. During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at another woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered writing. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.I first became aware of his lady's attitude toward him one night after the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l'Avenue's and afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several fines after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace. "I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town," I said.Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went on: "She's been there two years and knows everything there is to know about the town. She's a swell girl."I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert's lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening."Hell," I said, "why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to the Ardennes."Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner with me. "For God's sake," he said, "why did you say that about that girl in Strasbourg for? Didn't you see Frances?""No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg what the hell is it to Frances?""It doesn't make any difference. Any girl. I couldn't go, that would be all.""Don't be silly.""You don't know Frances. Any girl at all. Didn't you see the way she looked?""Oh, well," I said, "let's go to Senlis.""Don't get sore.""I'm not sore. Senlis is a good place and we can stay at the Grand Cerf and take a hike in the woods and come home.""Good, that will be fine.""Well, I'll see you to-morrow at the courts," I said."Good-night, Jake," he said, and started back to the café."You forgot to get your paper," I said."That's so." He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. "You are not sore, are you, Jake?" He turned with the paper in his hand."No, why should I be?""See you at tennis," he said. I watched him walk back to the café holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a life.That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college, and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a divine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have around. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread "The Purple Land." "The Purple Land" is a very sinister book if read too late in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took every word of "The Purple Land" as literally as though it had been an R. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on the whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until one day he came into my office."Hello, Robert," I said. "Did you come in to cheer me up?""Would you like to go to South America, Jake?" he asked."No.""Why not?""I don't know. I never wanted to go. Too expensive. You can see all the South Americans you want in Paris anyway.""They're not the real South Americans.""They look awfully real to me."I had a boat train to catch with a week's mail stories, and only half of them written."Do you know any dirt?" I asked."No.""None of your exalted connections getting divorces?""No; listen, Jake. If I handled both our expenses, would you go to South America with me?""Why me?""You can talk Spanish. And it would be more fun with two of us.""No," I said, "I like this town and I go to Spain in the summer-time.""All my life I've wanted to go on a trip like that," Cohn said. He sat down. "I'll be too old before I can ever do it.""Don't be a fool," I said. "You can go anywhere you want. You've got plenty of money.""I know. But I can't get started.""Cheer up," I said. "All countries look just like the moving pictures."But I felt sorry for him. He had it badly."I can't stand it to think my life is going so fast and I'm not really living it.""Nobody ever lives their life all the way up except bull-fighters.""I'm not interested in bull-fighters. That's an abnormal life. I want to go back in the country in South America. We could have a great trip.""Did you ever think about going to British East Africa to shoot?""No, I wouldn't like that.""I'd go there with you.""No; that doesn't interest me.""That's because you never read a book about it. Go on and read a book all full of love affairs with the beautiful shiny black princesses.""I want to go to South America."He had a hard, Jewish, stubborn streak."Come on down-stairs and have a drink.""Aren't you working?""No," I said. We went down the stairs to the café on the ground floor. I had discovered that was the best way to get rid of friends. Once you had a drink all you had to say was: "Well, I've got to get back and get off some cables," and it was done. It is very important to discover graceful exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we went down-stairs to the bar and had a whiskey and soda. Cohn looked at the bottles in bins around the wall. "This is a good place," he said."There's a lot of liquor," I agreed."Listen, Jake," he leaned forward on the bar. "Don't you ever get the feeling that all your life is going by and you're not taking advantage of it? Do you realize you've lived nearly half the time you have to live already?""Yes, every once in a while.""Do you know that in about thirty-five years more we'll be dead?""What the hell, Robert," I said. "What the hell.""I'm serious.""It's one thing I don't worry about," I said."You ought to.""I've had plenty to worry about one time or other. I'm through worrying.""Well, I want to go to South America.""Listen, Robert, going to another country doesn't make any difference. I've tried all that. You can't get away from yourself by moving from one place to another. There's nothing to that.""But you've never been to South America.""South America hell! If you went there the way you feel now it would be exactly the same. This is a good town. Why don't you start living your life in Paris?""I'm sick of Paris, and I'm sick of the Quarter.""Stay away from the Quarter. Cruise around by yourself and see what happens to you.""Nothing happens to me. I walked alone all one night and nothing happened except a bicycle cop stopped me and asked to see my papers.""Wasn't the town nice at night?""I don't care for Paris."So there you were. I was sorry for him, but it was not a thing you could do anything about, because right away you ran up against the two stubbornnesses: South America could fix it and he did not like Paris. He got the first idea out of a book, and I suppose the second came out of a book too."Well," I said, "I've got to go up-stairs and get off some cables.""Do you really have to go?""Yes, I've got to get these cables off.""Do you mind if I come up and sit around the office?""No, come on up."He sat in the outer room and read the papers, and the Editor and Publisher and I worked hard for two hours. Then I sorted out the carbons, stamped on a by-line, put the stuff in a couple of big manila envelopes and rang for a boy to take them to the Gare St. Lazare. I went out into the other room and there was Robert Cohn asleep in the big chair. He was asleep with his head on his arms. I did not like to wake him up, but I wanted to lock the office and shove off. I put my hand on his shoulder. He shook his head. "I can't do it," he said, and put his head deeper into his arms. "I can't do it. Nothing will make me do it.""Robert," I said, and shook him by the shoulder. He looked up. He smiled and blinked."Did I talk out loud just then?""Something. But it wasn't clear.""God, what a rotten dream!""Did the typewriter put you to sleep?""Guess so. I didn't sleep all last night.""What was the matter?""Talking," he said.I could picture it. I have a rotten habit of picturing the bedroom scenes of my friends. We went out to the Café Napolitain to have an apéritif and watch the evening crowd on the Boulevard.It was a warm spring night and I sat at a table on the terrace of the Napolitain after Robert had gone, watching it get dark and the electric signs come on, and the red and green stop-and-go traffic-signal, and the crowd going by, and the horse-cabs clippety-clopping along at the edge of the solid taxi traffic, and the poules going by, singly and in pairs, looking for the evening meal. I watched a good-looking girl walk past the table and watched her go up the street and lost sight of her, and watched another, and then saw the first one coming back again. She went by once more and I caught her eye, and she came over and sat down at the table. The waiter came up."Well, what will you drink?" I asked."Pernod.""That's not good for little girls.""Little girl yourself. Dites garçon, un pernod.""A pernod for me, too.""What's the matter?" she asked. "Going on a party?""Sure. Aren't you?""I don't know. You never know in this town.""Don't you like Paris?""No.""Why don't you go somewhere else?""Isn't anywhere else.""You're happy, all right.""Happy, hell!"Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns milky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops you just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen."Well," I said, "are you going to buy me a dinner?"She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling fiacre we moved up the Avenue de l'Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops, their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted. The cab passed the New York Herald bureau with the window full of clocks."What are all the clocks for?" she asked."They show the hour all over America.""Don't kid me."We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away."Never mind.""What's the matter? You sick?""Yes.""Everybody's sick. I'm sick, too."We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and then turned up the Rue des Saints Pères."You oughtn't to drink pernod if you're sick.""You neither.""It doesn't make any difference with me. It doesn't make any difference with a woman.""What are you called?""Georgette. How are you called?""Jacob.""That's a Flemish name.""American too.""You're not Flamand?""No, American.""Good, I detest Flamands."By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the cocher to stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place. "This is no great thing of a restaurant.""No," I said. "Maybe you would rather go to Foyot's. Why don't you keep the cab and go on?"I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be nice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a poule, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room. Georgette cheered up a little under the food."It isn't bad here," she said. "It isn't chic, but the food is all right.""Better than you eat in Liège.""Brussels, you mean."We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. "You're not a bad type," she said. "It's a shame you're sick. We get on well. What's the matter with you, anyway?""I got hurt in the war," I said."Oh, that dirty war."We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some one called: "Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!""It's a friend calling me," I explained, and went out.There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne, Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know."You're coming to the dance, aren't you?" Braddocks asked."What dance?""Why, the dancings. Don't you know we've revived them?" Mrs. Braddocks put in."You must come, Jake. We're all going," Frances said from the end of the table. She was tall and had a smile."Of course, he's coming," Braddocks said. "Come in and have coffee with us, Barnes.""Right.""And bring your friend," said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a Canadian and had all their easy social graces."Thanks, we'll be in," I said. I went back to the small room."Who are your friends?" Georgette asked."Writers and artists.""There are lots of those on this side of the river.""Too many.""I think so. Still, some of them make money.""Oh, yes."We finished the meal and the wine. "Come on," I said. "We're going to have coffee with the others."Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and straightened her hat."Good," she said.We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his table stood up."I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc," I said. Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round."Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?" Mrs. Braddocks asked."Connais pas," Georgette answered."But you have the same name," Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially."No," said Georgette. "Not at all. My name is Hobin.""But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely he did," insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking French was liable to have no idea what she was saying."He's a fool," Georgette said."Oh, it was a joke, then," Mrs. Braddocks said."Yes," said Georgette. "To laugh at.""Did you hear that, Henry?" Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to Braddocks. "Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc, and her name is actually Hobin.""Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I've known her for a very long time.""Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin," Frances Clyne called, speaking French very rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its coming out really French. "Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it here? You love Paris, do you not?""Who's she?" Georgette turned to me. "Do I have to talk to her?"She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again."No, I don't like Paris. It's expensive and dirty.""Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities in all Europe.""I find it dirty.""How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.""I've been here long enough.""But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that."Georgette turned to me. "You have nice friends."Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all went out and started for Braddocks's dancing-club.The dancing-club was a bal musette in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte Geneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the zinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came downstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor."I wish people would come earlier," Braddocks said. The daughter came up and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor perspiring."My God," Georgette said. "What a box to sweat in!""It's hot.""Hot, my God!""Take off your hat.""That's a good idea."Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of wind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They both stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces, grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very lovely and she was very much with them.One of them saw Georgette and said: "I do declare. There is an actual harlot. I'm going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me."The tall dark one, called Lett, said: "Don't you be rash."The wavy blond one answered: "Don't you worry, dear." And with them was Brett.I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering composure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar at the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take the taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he danced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all dance with her. They are like that.I sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs. Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink."Thanks so much," he said, "I've just had one.""Have another.""Thanks, I will then."We got the daughter of the house over and each had a fine à l'eau."You're from Kansas City, they tell me," he said."Yes.""Do you find Paris amusing?""Yes.""Really?"I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to be careless."For God's sake," I said, "yes. Don't you?""Oh, how charmingly you get angry," he said. "I wish I had that faculty."I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks followed me. "Don't be cross with Robert," she said. "He's still only a child, you know.""I wasn't cross," I said. "I just thought perhaps I was going to throw up.""Your fiancée is having a great success," Mrs. Braddocks looked out on the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one, called Lett."Isn't she?" I said."Rather," said Mrs. Braddocks.Cohn came up. "Come on, Jake," he said, "have a drink." We walked over to the bar. "What's the matter with you? You seem all worked up over something?""Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all."Brett came up to the bar."Hello, you chaps.""Hello, Brett," I said. "Why aren't you tight?""Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and soda."She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the promised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look of eager, deserving expectation.Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started all that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you missed none of it with that wool jersey."It's a fine crowd you're with, Brett," I said."Aren't they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?""At the Napolitain.""And have you had a lovely evening?""Oh, priceless," I said.Brett laughed. "It's wrong of you, Jake. It's an insult to all of us. Look at Frances there, and Jo."This for Cohn's benefit."It's in restraint of trade," Brett said. She laughed again."You're wonderfully sober," I said."Yes. Aren't I? And when one's with the crowd I'm with, one can drink in such safety, too."The music started and Robert Cohn said: "Will you dance this with me, Lady Brett?"Brett smiled at him. "I've promised to dance this with Jacob," she laughed. "You've a hell of a biblical name, Jake.""How about the next?" asked Cohn."We're going," Brett said. "We've a date up at Montmartre." Dancing, I looked over Brett's shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still watching her."You've made a new one there," I said to her."Don't talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.""Oh, well," I said. "I suppose you like to add them up.""Don't talk like a fool.""You do.""Oh, well. What if I do?""Nothing," I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to Georgette dancing with another one of them."What possessed you to bring her?""I don't know, I just brought her.""You're getting damned romantic.""No, bored.""Now?""No, not now.""Let's get out of here. She's well taken care of.""Do you want to?""Would I ask you if I didn't want to?"We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it on. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and handed it to the patronne."If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?" I said. "If she goes out with one of those gentlemen, will you save this for me?""C'est entendu, Monsieur," the patronne said. "You go now? So early?""Yes," I said.We started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good night and took my arm. "Good night, Cohn," I said. Outside in the street we looked for a taxi."You're going to lose your fifty francs," Brett said."Oh, yes.""No taxis.""We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.""Come on and we'll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.""You wouldn't walk across the street.""Not if I could help it."We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi."Well," I said, "we're out away from them."We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. "Where should I tell him?" I asked."Oh, tell him to drive around."I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got in and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk."Oh, darling, I've been so miserable," Brett said.The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St. Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted close together going down the old street. Brett's hat was off. Her head was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des Gobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks by the light of acetylene flares. Brett's face was white and the long line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away as she could get. Her head was down."Don't touch me," she said. "Please don't touch me.""What's the matter?""I can't stand it.""Oh, Brett.""You mustn't. You must know. I can't stand it, that's all. Oh, darling, please understand!""Don't you love me?""Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.""Isn't there anything we can do about it?"She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back against me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw out of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else's eyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she was afraid of so many things."And there's not a damn thing we could do," I said."I don't know," she said. "I don't want to go through that hell again.""We'd better keep away from each other.""But, darling, I have to see you. It isn't all that you know.""No, but it always gets to be.""That's my fault. Don't we pay for all the things we do, though?"She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the way into them."When I think of the hell I've put chaps through. I'm paying for it all now.""Don't talk like a fool," I said. "Besides, what happened to me is supposed to be funny. I never think about it.""Oh, no. I'll lay you don't.""Well, let's shut up about it.""I laughed about it too, myself, once." She wasn't looking at me. "A friend of my brother's came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?""No," I said. "Nobody ever knows anything."I was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them."It's funny," I said. "It's very funny. And it's a lot of fun, too, to be in love.""Do you think so?" her eyes looked flat again."I don't mean fun that way. In a way it's an enjoyable feeling.""No," she said. "I think it's hell on earth.""It's good to see each other.""No. I don't think it is.""Don't you want to?""I have to."We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The driver leaned his head around."Where do you want to go?" I asked. Brett turned her head away."Oh, go to the Select.""Café Select," I told the driver. "Boulevard Montparnasse." We drove straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: "Would you mind very much if I asked you to do something?""Don't be silly.""Kiss me just once more before we get there."When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. "I say, do I look too much of a mess?" She pulled her man's felt hat down and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were most of the crowd who a been at the dance."Hello, you chaps," Brett said. "I'm going to have a drink.""Oh, Brett! Brett!" the little Greek portrait-painter, who called himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. "I got something fine to tell you.""Hello, Zizi," Brett said."I want you to meet a friend," Zizi said. A fat man came up."Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.""How do you do?" said Brett."Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?" asked Count Mippipopolous, who wore an elk's tooth on his watch-chain."Rather," said Brett."Paris is a fine town all right," said the count. "But I guess you have pretty big doings yourself over in London.""Oh, yes," said Brett. "Enormous."Braddocks called to me from a table. "Barnes," he said, "have a drink. That girl of yours got in a frightful row.""What about?""Something the patronne's daughter said. A corking row. She was rather splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne's daughter's too. I say it was a row.""What finally happened?""Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.""No," I said. "I must shove off. Seen Cohn?""He went home with Frances," Mrs. Braddock put in."Poor chap, he looks awfully down," Braddocks said."I dare say he is," said Mrs. Braddocks."I have to shove off," I said. "Good night."I said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne. "Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?" he asked."No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.""Really going?" Brett asked."Yes," I said. "I've got a rotten headache.""I'll see you to-morrow?""Come in at the office.""Hardly.""Well, where will I see you?""Anywhere around five o'clock.""Make it the other side of town then.""Good. I'll be at the Crillon at five.""Try and be there," I said."Don't worry," Brett said. "I've never let you down, have I?""Heard from Mike?""Letter to-day.""Good night, sir," said the count.I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St. Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the pavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was and went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was deserted. Lavigne's was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables outside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney's statue standing among the new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription: from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine, Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green new horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little way down the Boulevard St. Michel.There was a light in the concierge's room and I knocked on the door and she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There were two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light in the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered I had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement. The other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine--I knew neither the girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town. It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name like Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the announcement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was funny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell with you, Lady Ashley.I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide windows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the windows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They were noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a typically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their wrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. Le Toril was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian hospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was the Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was Zonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was funny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But they had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: "You, a foreigner, an Englishman" (any foreigner was an Englishman) "have given more than your life." What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated to hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my place, I guess. "Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!"I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble if I hadn't run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose she only wanted what she couldn't have. Well, people were that way. To hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn't keep away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I went to sleep.I woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The concierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name and called down the stairs."Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?" the concierge called."Yes. It's me.""There's a species of woman here who's waked the whole street up. What kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see you. I've told her you're asleep."Then I heard Brett's voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was Georgette. I don't know why. She could not have known my address."Will you send her up, please?"Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. "Silly thing to do," she said. "Make an awful row. I say, you weren't asleep, were you?""What did you think I was doing?""Don't know. What time is it?"I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. "Had no idea what hour it was," Brett said. "I say, can a chap sit down? Don't be cross, darling. Just left the count. He brought me here.""What's he like?" I was getting brandy and soda and glasses."Just a little," said Brett. "Don't try and make me drunk. The count? Oh, rather. He's quite one of us.""Is he a count?""Here's how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows hell's own amount about people. Don't know where he got it all. Owns a chain of sweetshops in the States."She sipped at her glass."Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up. Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He's one of us, though. Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell."She took another drink."How do I buck on about all this? You don't mind, do you? He's putting up for Zizi, you know.""Is Zizi really a duke, too?""I shouldn't wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the count.""Where did you go with him?""Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?""Around two thousand.""Lot of money. I told him I couldn't do it. He was awfully nice about it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz."Brett laughed."I say, you are slow on the up-take," she said. I had only sipped my brandy and soda. I took a long drink."That's better. Very funny," Brett said. "Then he wanted me to go to Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many people everywhere. Quite true, too. So I asked him to bring me here."She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. "Don't look like that," she said. "Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don't look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to dinner to-morrow night. Like to go?""Why not?""I'd better go now.""Why?""Just wanted to see you. Damned silly idea. Want to get dressed and come down? He's got the car just up the street.""The count?""Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have breakfast in the Bois. Hampers. Got it all at Zelli's. Dozen bottles of Mumms. Tempt you?""I have to work in the morning," I said. "I'm too far behind you now to catch up and be any fun.""Don't be an ass.""Can't do it.""Right. Send him a tender message?""Anything. Absolutely.""Good night, darling.""Don't be sentimental.""You make me ill."We kissed good night and Brett shivered. "I'd better go," she said. "Good night, darling.""You don't have to go.""Yes."We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a glass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen and poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into bed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at night it is another thing.In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy. Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in to my office.Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning's work. At eleven o'clock I went over to the Quai d'Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece, a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles, talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back. Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d'Orsay with Woolsey and Krum."What do you do nights, Jake?" asked Krum. "I never see you around.""Oh, I'm over in the Quarter.""I'm coming over some night. The Dingo. That's the great place, isn't it?""Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select.""I've meant to get over," said Krum. "You know how it is, though, with a wife and kids.""Playing any tennis?" Woolsey asked."Well, no," said Krum. "I can't say I've played any this year. I've tried to get away, but Sundays it's always rained, and the courts are so damned crowded.""The Englishmen all have Saturday off," Woolsey said."Lucky beggars," said Krum. "Well, I'll tell you. Some day I'm not going to be working for an agency. Then I'll have plenty of time to get out in the country.""That's the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.""I've been thinking some about getting a car next year."I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. "Here's my street," I said. "Come in and have a drink.""Thanks, old man," Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. "I've got to file that line he got off this morning."I put a two-franc piece in Krum's hand."You're crazy, Jake," he said. "This is on me.""It's all on the office, anyway.""Nope. I want to get it."I waved good-by. Krum put his head out. "See you at the lunch on Wednesday.""You bet."I went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me. "Hello, Jake," he said. "Going out to lunch?""Yes. Let me see if there is anything new.""Where will we eat?""Anywhere."I was looking over my desk. "Where do you want to eat?""How about Wetzel's? They've got good hors d'oeuvres."In the restaurant we ordered hors d'oeuvres and beer. The sommelier brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold. There were a dozen different dishes of hors d'oeuvres."Have any fun last night?" I asked."No. I don't think so.""How's the writing going?""Rotten. I can't get this second book going.""That happens to everybody.""Oh, I'm sure of that. It gets me worried, though.""Thought any more about going to South America?""I mean that.""Well, why don't you start off?""Frances.""Well," I said, "take her with you.""She wouldn't like it. That isn't the sort of thing she likes. She likes a lot of people around.""Tell her to go to hell.""I can't. I've got certain obligations to her."He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring."What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?""Her name's Lady Ashley. Brett's her own name. She's a nice girl," I said. "She's getting a divorce and she's going to marry Mike Campbell. He's over in Scotland now. Why?""She's a remarkably attractive woman.""Isn't she?""There's a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to be absolutely fine and straight.""She's very nice.""I don't know how to describe the quality," Cohn said. "I suppose it's breeding.""You sound as though you liked her pretty well.""I do. I shouldn't wonder if I were in love with her.""She's a drunk," I said. "She's in love with Mike Campbell, and she's going to marry him. He's going to be rich as hell some day.""I don't believe she'll ever marry him.""Why not?""I don't know. I just don't believe it. Have you known her a long time?""Yes," I said. "She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the war.""She must have been just a kid then.""She's thirty-four now.""When did she marry Ashley?""During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the dysentery.""You talk sort of bitter.""Sorry. I didn't mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.""I don't believe she would marry anybody she didn't love.""Well," I said. "She's done it twice.""I don't believe it.""Well," I said, "don't ask me a lot of fool questions if you don't like the answers.""I didn't ask you that.""You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.""I didn't ask you to insult her.""Oh, go to hell."He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and angry behind the little plates of hors d'oeuvres."Sit down," I said. "Don't be a fool.""You've got to take that back.""Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.""Take it back.""Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How's that?"No. Not that. About me going to hell.""Oh, don't go to hell," I said. "Stick around. We're just starting lunch."Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the hell would he have done if he hadn't sat down? "You say such damned insulting things, Jake.""I'm sorry. I've got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty things.""I know it," Cohn said. "You're really about the best friend I have, Jake."God help you, I thought. "Forget what I said," I said out loud. "I'm sorry.""It's all right. It's fine. I was just sore for a minute.""Good. Let's get something else to eat."After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had coffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him off it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to the office.At five o'clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them. Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a taxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let that part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull riding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and dull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that makes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read something about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris. Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave."Sit down," said Harvey, "I've been looking for you.""What's the matter?""Nothing. Just looking for you.""Been out to the races?""No. Not since Sunday.""What do you hear from the States?""Nothing. Absolutely nothing.""What's the matter?""I don't know. I'm through with them. I'm absolutely through with them."He leaned forward and looked me in the eye."Do you want to know something, Jake?""Yes.""I haven't had anything to eat for five days."I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar."What's the matter?""No money. Money hasn't come," he paused. "I tell you it's strange, Jake. When I'm like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my own room. I'm like a cat."I felt in my pocket."Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?""Yes.""Come on. Let's go and eat.""There's no hurry. Have a drink.""Better eat.""No. When I get like this I don't care whether I eat or not."We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile."Do you know Mencken, Harvey?""Yes. Why?""What's he like?""He's all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. 'The trouble is,' he said, 'he's a garter snapper.' That's not bad.""That's not bad.""He's through now," Harvey went on. "He's written about all the things he knows, and now he's on all the things he doesn't know.""I guess he's all right," I said. "I just can't read him.""Oh, nobody reads him now," Harvey said, "except the people that used to read the Alexander Hamilton Institute.""Well," I said. "That was a good thing, too.""Sure," said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while."Have another port?""All right," said Harvey."There comes Cohn," I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street."That moron," said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table."Hello, you bums," he said."Hello, Robert," Harvey said. "I was just telling Jake here that you're a moron.""What do you mean?""Tell us right off. Don't think. What would you rather do if you could do anything you wanted?"Cohn started to consider."Don't think. Bring it right out.""I don't know," Cohn said. "What's it all about, anyway?""I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No matter how silly it is.""I don't know," Cohn said. "I think I'd rather play football again with what I know about handling myself, now.""I misjudged you," Harvey said. "You're not a moron. You're only a case of arrested development.""You're awfully funny, Harvey," Cohn said. "Some day somebody will push your face in."Harvey Stone laughed. "You think so. They won't, though. Because it wouldn't make any difference to me. I'm not a fighter.""It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.""No, it wouldn't. That's where you make your big mistake. Because you're not intelligent.""Cut it out about me.""Sure," said Harvey. "It doesn't make any difference to me. You don't mean anything to me.""Come on, Harvey," I said. "Have another porto.""No," he said. "I'm going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake."He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic."He always gets me sore," Cohn said. "I can't stand him.""I like him," I said. "I'm fond of him. You don't want to get sore at him.""I know it," Cohn said. "He just gets on my nerves.""Write this afternoon?""No. I couldn't get it going. It's harder to do than my first book. I'm having a hard time handling it."The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone. Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey Stone had just crossed the street."Come on up to the Lilas," I said."I have a date.""What time?""Frances is coming here at seven-fifteen.""There she is."Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street."Hello," she said, "I'm so glad you're here, Jake. I've been wanting to talk to you.""Hello, Frances," said Cohn. He smiled."Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?" She went on, talking rapidly. "I've had the darndest time. This one"--shaking her head at Cohn--"didn't come home for lunch.""I wasn't supposed to.""Oh, I know. But you didn't say anything about it to the cook. Then I had a date myself, and Paula wasn't at her office. I went to the Ritz and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz----""What did you do?""Oh, went out, of course." She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful manner. "I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?""Fine.""That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that Brett one.""Don't you like her?" Cohn asked."I think she's perfectly charming. Don't you?"Cohn said nothing."Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the Dome? You'll stay here, won't you, Robert? Come on, Jake."We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy came up with the Paris Times, and I bought one and opened it."What's the matter, Frances?""Oh, nothing," she said, "except that he wants to leave me.""How do you mean?""Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my mother and every one, and now he doesn't want to do it.""What's the matter?""He's decided he hasn't lived enough. I knew it would happen when he went to New York."She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially."I wouldn't marry him if he doesn't want to. Of course I wouldn't. I wouldn't marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a little late now, after we've waited three years, and I've just gotten my divorce."I said nothing."We were going to celebrate so, and instead we've just had scenes. It's so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be reasonable, but he says he just can't do it.""It's rotten luck.""I should say it is rotten luck. I've wasted two years and a half on him now. And I don't know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me. Now I don't think I could get anybody.""Sure, you could marry anybody.""No, I don't believe it. And I'm fond of him, too. And I'd like to have children. I always thought we'd have children."She looked at me very brightly. "I never liked children much, but I don't want to think I'll never have them. I always thought I'd have them and then like them.""He's got children.""Oh, yes. He's got children, and he's got money, and he's got a rich mother, and he's written a book, and nobody will publish my stuff; nobody at all. It isn't bad, either. And I haven't got any money at all. I could have had alimony, but I got the divorce the quickest way."She looked at me again very brightly."It isn't right. It's my own fault and it's not, too. I ought to have known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can't marry. Why can't he marry? I'd be a good wife. I'm easy to get along with. I leave him alone. It doesn't do any good.""It's a rotten shame.""Yes, it is a rotten shame. But there's no use talking about it, is there? Come on, let's go back to the café.""And of course there isn't anything I can do.""No. Just don't let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants." Now for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. "He wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it. That's what he wants.""Maybe they won't like it. I don't think he's that way. Really.""You don't know him like I do, Jake. That's what he wants to do. I know it. I know it. That's why he doesn't want to marry. He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself.""Want to go back to the café?""Yes. Come on."We got up from the table--they had never brought us a drink--and started across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from behind the marble-topped table."Well, what are you smiling at?" Frances asked him. "Feel pretty happy?""I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.""Oh, what I've told Jake isn't any secret. Everybody will know it soon enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.""What was it? About your going to England?""Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I'm going to England.""Isn't that fine!""Yes, that's the way it's done in the very best families. Robert's sending me. He's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I'm going to visit friends. Won't it be lovely? The friends don't know about it, yet."She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now."You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren't you, Robert? But I made him give me two hundred. He's really very generous. Aren't you, Robert?"I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn. There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly joking to what went on later."How can you say such things, Frances?" Cohn interrupted."Listen to him. I'm going to England. I'm going to visit friends. Ever visit friends that didn't want you? Oh, they'll have to take me, all right. 'How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we've seen you. And how is your dear mother?' Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person in the world that did. 'And what about Robert?' or else very careful talking around Robert. 'You must be most careful not to mention him, my dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.' Won't it be fun, Robert? Don't you think it will be fun, Jake?"She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very satisfactory to her to have an audience for this."And where are you going to be, Robert? It's my own fault, all right. Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you'd get rid of me the same way. Jake doesn't know about that. Should I tell him?""Shut up, Frances, for God's sake.""Yes, I'll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful, too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn't even pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was pretty fine, then. Didn't you, Robert?"You mustn't misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn't that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert."You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren't you, Robert? That's why he's leaving me. He's decided I don't film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn't remember anything about us. So now he's going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting."Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won't mind, will you? Don't have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you can't have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you can't remember what the other person's said. You'll never be able to remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it's awfully hard. But remember, it's for literature. We all ought to make sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I'm going to England without a protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don't you think so, Jake? But you're not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You're thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert doesn't think he's any good, though. Some of his French friends told him. He doesn't read French very well himself. He wasn't a good writer like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he wouldn't marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I've just thought of something." She put her gloved hand up to her lips. "I know the real reason why Robert won't marry me, Jake. It's just come to me. They've sent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn't it mystic? Some day they'll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert? I'll tell you. It's so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it. Why, you see, Robert's always wanted to have a mistress, and if he doesn't marry me, why, then he's had one. She was his mistress for over two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he's always promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don't you think that's bright of me to figure that out? It's true, too. Look at him and see if it's not. Where are you going, Jake?""I've got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute."Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there? Why did he keep on taking it like that?As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into his face each time she asked: "Isn't it so, Robert?" Or maybe she did not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave the driver the address of my flat.As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters and a telegram."Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.""Did she leave a card?""No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice.""Was she with a friend of mine?""I don't know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little--" She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. "I'll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to what I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see.""They did not leave any word?""Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.""Send them up when they come.""Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu'une, quelqu'une!"The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse, but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge. The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the France. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom, undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door. It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of roses."Hello, darling," said Brett. "Aren't you going to let us in?""Come on. I was just bathing.""Aren't you the fortunate man. Bathing.""Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?""I don't know whether you like flowers, sir," the count said, "but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses.""Here, give them to me." Brett took them. "Get me some water in this, Jake." I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the dining-room table."I say. We have had a day.""You don't remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?""No. Did we have one? I must have been blind.""You were quite drunk, my dear," said the count."Wasn't I, though? And the count's been a brick, absolutely.""You've got hell's own drag with the concierge now.""I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.""Don't be a damned fool.""His," she said, and nodded at the count."I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It was very late.""He's wonderful," Brett said. "He remembers everything that's happened.""So do you, my dear.""Fancy," said Brett. "Who'd want to? I say, Jake, do we get a drink?""You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.""Rather."While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand, and sat on the bed."What's the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?"She kissed me coolly on the forehead."Oh, Brett, I love you so much.""Darling," she said. Then: "Do you want me to send him away?""No. He's nice.""I'll send him away.""No, don't.""Yes, I'll send him away.""You can't just like that.""Can't I, though? You stay here. He's mad about me, I tell you."She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and sat on the bed."Poor old darling." She stroked my head."What did you say to him?" I was lying with my face away from her. I did not want to see her."Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne."Then later: "Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?""It's better.""Lie quiet. He's gone to the other side of town.""Couldn't we live together, Brett? Couldn't we just live together?""I don't think so. I'd just tromper you with everybody. You couldn't stand it.""I stand it now.""That would be different. It's my fault, Jake. It's the way I'm made.""Couldn't we go off in the country for a while?""It wouldn't be any good. I'll go if you like. But I couldn't live quietly in the country. Not with my own true love.""I know.""Isn't it rotten? There isn't any use my telling you I love you.""You know I love you.""Let's not talk. Talking's all bilge. I'm going away from you, and then Michael's coming back.""Why are you going away?""Better for you. Better for me.""When are you going?""Soon as I can.""Where?""San Sebastian.""Can't we go together?""No. That would be a hell of an idea after we'd just talked it out.""We never agreed.""Oh, you know as well as I do. Don't be obstinate, darling.""Oh, sure," I said. "I know you're right. I'm just low, and when I'm low I talk like a fool."I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I stood up."Don't look like that, darling.""How do you want me to look?""Oh, don't be a fool. I'm going away to-morrow.""To-morrow?""Yes. Didn't I say so? I am.""Let's have a drink, then. The count will be back.""Yes. He should be back. You know he's extraordinary about buying champagne. It means any amount to him."We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured Brett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur carrying a basket of champagne."Where should I have him put it, sir?" asked the count."In the kitchen," Brett said."Put it in there, Henry," the count motioned. "Now go down and get the ice." He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. "I think you'll find that's very good wine," he said. "I know we don't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this from a friend of mine that's in the business.""Oh, you always have some one in the trade," Brett said."This fellow raises the grapes. He's got thousands of acres of them.""What's his name?" asked Brett. "Veuve Cliquot?""No," said the count. "Mumms. He's a baron.""Isn't it wonderful," said Brett. "We all have titles. Why haven't you a title, Jake?""I assure you, sir," the count put his hand on my arm. "It never does a man any good. Most of the time it costs you money.""Oh, I don't know. It's damned useful sometimes," Brett said."I've never known it to do me any good.""You haven't used it properly. I've had hell's own amount of credit on mine.""Do sit down, count," I said. "Let me take that stick."The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me notice it. "I say, Jake, I don't want to ruin your rugs. Can't you give a chap an ash-tray?"I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up with a bucket full of salted ice. "Put two bottles in it, Henry," the count called."Anything else, sir?""No. Wait down in the car." He turned to Brett and to me. "We'll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner?""If you like," Brett said. "I couldn't eat a thing.""I always like a good meal," said the count."Should I bring the wine in, sir?" asked the chauffeur."Yes. Bring it in, Henry," said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin cigar-case and offered it to me. "Like to try a real American cigar?""Thanks," I said. "I'll finish the cigarette."He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of his watch-chain."I like a cigar to really draw," said the count "Half the cigars you smoke don't draw."He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. "And when you're divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won't have a title.""No. What a pity.""No," said the count. "You don't need a title. You got class all over you.""Thanks. Awfully decent of you.""I'm not joking you," the count blew a cloud of smoke. "You got the most class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That's all.""Nice of you," said Brett. "Mummy would be pleased. Couldn't you write it out, and I'll send it in a letter to her.""I'd tell her, too," said the count. "I'm not joking you. I never joke people. Joke people and you make enemies. That's what I always say.""You're right," Brett said. "You're terribly right. I always joke people and I haven't a friend in the world. Except Jake here.""You don't joke him.""That's it.""Do you, now?" asked the count. "Do you joke him?"Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes."No," she said. "I wouldn't joke him.""See," said the count. "You don't joke him.""This is a hell of a dull talk," Brett said. "How about some of that champagne?"The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. "It isn't cold, yet. You're always drinking, my dear. Why don't you just talk?""I've talked too ruddy much. I've talked myself all out to Jake.""I should like to hear you really talk, my dear. When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all.""Leave 'em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.""It is a very interesting system," the count reached down and gave the bottles a twirl. "Still I would like to hear you talk some time.""Isn't he a fool?" Brett asked."Now," the count brought up a bottle. "I think this is cool."I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. "I like to drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool." He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the glasses."I say. You might open it," Brett suggested."Yes, my dear. Now I'll open it."It was amazing champagne."I say that is wine," Brett held up her glass. "We ought to toast something. 'Here's to royalty.'""This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don't want to mix emotions up with a wine like that. You lose the taste."Brett's glass was empty."You ought to write a book on wines, count," I said."Mr. Barnes," answered the count, "all I want out of wines is to enjoy them.""Let's enjoy a little more of this," Brett pushed her glass forward. The count poured very carefully. "There, my dear. Now you enjoy that slowly, and then you can get drunk.""Drunk? Drunk?""My dear, you are charming when you are drunk.""Listen to the man.""Mr. Barnes," the count poured my glass full. "She is the only lady I have ever known who was as charming when she was drunk as when she was sober.""You haven't been around much, have you?""Yes, my dear. I have been around very much. I have been around a very great deal.""Drink your wine," said Brett. "We've all been around. I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have.""My dear, I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot. Don't think I don't think so, sir. I have seen a lot, too.""Of course you have, my dear," Brett said. "I was only ragging.""I have been in seven wars and four revolutions," the count said."Soldiering?" Brett asked."Sometimes, my dear. And I have got arrow wounds. Have you ever seen arrow wounds?""Let's have a look at them."The count stood up, unbuttoned his vest, and opened his shirt. He pulled up the undershirt onto his chest and stood, his chest black, and big stomach muscles bulging under the light."You see them?"Below the line where his ribs stopped were two raised white welts. "See on the back where they come out." Above the small of the back were the same two scars, raised as thick as a finger."I say. Those are something.""Clean through."The count was tucking in his shirt."Where did you get those?" I asked."In Abyssinia. When I was twenty-one years old.""What were you doing?" asked Brett. "Were you in the army?""I was on a business trip, my dear.""I told you he was one of us. Didn't I?" Brett turned to me. "I love you, count. You're a darling.""You make me very happy, my dear. But it isn't true.""Don't be an ass.""You see, Mr. Barnes, it is because I have lived very much that now I can enjoy everything so well. Don't you find it like that?""Yes. Absolutely.""I know," said the count. "That is the secret. You must get to know the values.""Doesn't anything ever happen to your values?" Brett asked."No. Not any more.""Never fall in love?""Always," said the count. "I am always in love.""What does that do to your values?""That, too, has got a place in my values.""You haven't any values. You're dead, that's all.""No, my dear. You're not right. I'm not dead at all."We drank three bottles of the champagne and the count left the basket in my kitchen. We dined at a restaurant in the Bois. It was a good dinner. Food had an excellent place in the count's values. So did wine. The count was in fine form during the meal. So was Brett. It was a good party."Where would you like to go?" asked the count after dinner. We were the only people left in the restaurant. The two waiters were standing over against the door. They wanted to go home."We might go up on the hill," Brett said. "Haven't we had a splendid party?"The count was beaming. He was very happy."You are very nice people," he said. He was smoking a cigar again. "Why don't you get married, you two?""We want to lead our own lives," I said."We have our careers," Brett said. "Come on. Let's get out of this.""Have another brandy," the count said."Get it on the hill.""No. Have it here where it is quiet.""You and your quiet," said Brett. "What is it men feel about quiet?""We like it," said the count. "Like you like noise, my dear.""All right," said Brett. "Let's have one.""Sommelier!" the count called."Yes, sir.""What is the oldest brandy you have?""Eighteen eleven, sir.""Bring us a bottle.""I say. Don't be ostentatious. Call him off, Jake.""Listen, my dear. I get more value for my money in old brandy than in any other antiquities.""Got many antiquities?""I got a houseful."Finally we went up to Montmartre. Inside Zelli's it was crowded, smoky, and noisy. The music hit you as you went in. Brett and I danced. It was so crowded we could barely move. The nigger drummer waved at Brett. We were caught in the jam, dancing in one place in front of him."Hahre you?""Great.""Thaats good."He was all teeth and lips."He's a great friend of mine," Brett said. "Damn good drummer."The music stopped and we started toward the table where the count sat. Then the music started again and we danced. I looked at the count. He was sitting at the table smoking a cigar. The music stopped again."Let's go over."Brett started toward the table. The music started and again we danced, tight in the crowd."You are a rotten dancer, Jake. Michael's the best dancer I know.""He's splendid.""He's got his points.""I like him," I said. "I'm damned fond of him.""I'm going to marry him," Brett said. "Funny. I haven't thought about him for a week.""Don't you write him?""Not I. Never write letters.""I'll bet he writes to you.""Rather. Damned good letters, too.""When are you going to get married?""How do I know? As soon as we can get the divorce. Michael's trying to get his mother to put up for it.""Could I help you?""Don't be an ass. Michael's people have loads of money."The music stopped. We walked over to the table. The count stood up."Very nice," he said. "You looked very, very nice.""Don't you dance, count?" I asked."No. I'm too old.""Oh, come off it," Brett said."My dear, I would do it if I would enjoy it. I enjoy to watch you dance.""Splendid," Brett said. "I'll dance again for you some time. I say. What about your little friend, Zizi?""Let me tell you. I support that boy, but I don't want to have him around.""He is rather hard.""You know I think that boy's got a future. But personally I don't want him around.""Jake's rather the same way.""He gives me the willys.""Well," the count shrugged his shoulders. "About his future you can't ever tell. Anyhow, his father was a great friend of my father.""Come on. Let's dance," Brett said.We danced. It was crowded and close."Oh, darling," Brett said, "I'm so miserable."I had that feeling of going through something that has all happened before. "You were happy a minute ago."The drummer shouted: "You can't two time--""It's all gone.""What's the matter?""I don't know. I just feel terribly.""......" the drummer chanted. Then turned to his sticks."Want to go?"I had the feeling as in a nightmare of it all being something repeated, something I had been through and that now I must go through again."......" the drummer sang softly."Let's go," said Brett. "You don't mind.""......" the drummer shouted and grinned at Brett."All right," I said. We got out from the crowd. Brett went to the dressing-room."Brett wants to go," I said to the count. He nodded. "Does she? That's fine. You take the car. I'm going to stay here for a while, Mr. Barnes."We shook hands."It was a wonderful time," I said. "I wish you would let me get this." I took a note out of my pocket."Mr. Barnes, don't be ridiculous," the count said.Brett came over with her wrap on. She kissed the count and put her hand on his shoulder to keep him from standing up. As we went out the door I looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel."No, don't come up," she said at the hotel. She had rung and the door was unlatched."Really?""No. Please.""Good night, Brett," I said. "I'm sorry you feel rotten.""Good night, Jake. Good night, darling. I won't see you again." We kissed standing at the door. She pushed me away. We kissed again. "Oh, don't!" Brett said.She turned quickly and went into the hotel. The chauffeur drove me around to my flat. I gave him twenty francs and he touched his cap and said: "Good night, sir," and drove off. I rang the bell. The door opened and I went up-stairs and went to bed.I did not see Brett again until she came back from San Sebastian. One card came from her from there. It had a picture of the Concha, and said: "Darling. Very quiet and healthy. Love to all the chaps. BRETT."Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach him always, he wrote, through his bankers.Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn's troubles, I rather enjoyed not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of June. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful. New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a whole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to make a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he went off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He wrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: "Jake, Budapest is wonderful." Then I got a wire: "Back on Monday."Monday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying his bags. I met him on the stairs, and took one of the bags."Well," I said, "I hear you had a wonderful trip.""Wonderful," he said. "Budapest is absolutely wonderful.""How about Vienna?""Not so good, Jake. Not so good. It seemed better than it was.""How do you mean?" I was getting glasses and a siphon."Tight, Jake. I was tight.""That's strange. Better have a drink."Bill rubbed his forehead. "Remarkable thing," he said. "Don't know how it happened. Suddenly it happened.""Last long?""Four days, Jake. Lasted just four days.""Where did you go?""Don't remember. Wrote you a post-card. Remember that perfectly.""Do anything else?""Not so sure. Possible.""Go on. Tell me about it.""Can't remember. Tell you anything I could remember.""Go on. Take that drink and remember.""Might remember a little," Bill said. "Remember something about a prize-fight. Enormous Vienna prize-fight. Had a nigger in it. Remember the nigger perfectly.""Go on.""Wonderful nigger. Looked like Tiger Flowers, only four times as big. All of a sudden everybody started to throw things. Not me. Nigger'd just knocked local boy down. Nigger put up his glove. Wanted to make a speech. Awful noble-looking nigger. Started to make a speech. Then local white boy hit him. Then he knocked white boy cold. Then everybody commenced to throw chairs. Nigger went home with us in our car. Couldn't get his clothes. Wore my coat. Remember the whole thing now. Big sporting evening.""What happened?""Loaned the nigger some clothes and went around with him to try and get his money. Claimed nigger owed them money on account of wrecking hall. Wonder who translated? Was it me?""Probably it wasn't you.""You're right. Wasn't me at all. Was another fellow. Think we called him the local Harvard man. Remember him now. Studying music.""How'd you come out?""Not so good, Jake. Injustice everywhere. Promoter claimed nigger promised let local boy stay. Claimed nigger violated contract. Can't knock out Vienna boy in Vienna. 'My God, Mister Gorton,' said nigger, 'I didn't do nothing in there for forty minutes but try and let him stay. That white boy musta ruptured himself swinging at me. I never did hit him.'""Did you get any money?""No money, Jake. All we could get was nigger's clothes. Somebody took his watch, too. Splendid nigger. Big mistake to have come to Vienna. Not so good, Jake. Not so good.""What became of the nigger?""Went back to Cologne. Lives there. Married. Got a family. Going to write me a letter and send me the money I loaned him. Wonderful nigger. Hope I gave him the right address.""You probably did.""Well, anyway, let's eat," said Bill. "Unless you want me to tell you some more travel stories.""Go on.""Let's eat."We went down-stairs and out onto the Boulevard St. Michel in the warm June evening."Where will we go?""Want to eat on the island?""Sure."We walked down the Boulevard. At the juncture of the Rue Denfert-Rochereau with the Boulevard is a statue of two men in flowing robes."I know who they are." Bill eyed the monument. "Gentlemen who invented pharmacy. Don't try and fool me on Paris."We went on."Here's a taxidermist's," Bill said. "Want to buy anything? Nice stuffed dog?""Come on," I said. "You're pie-eyed.""Pretty nice stuffed dogs," Bill said. "Certainly brighten up your flat.""Come on.""Just one stuffed dog. I can take 'em or leave 'em alone. But listen, Jake. Just one stuffed dog.""Come on.""Mean everything in the world to you after you bought it. Simple exchange of values. You give them money. They give you a stuffed dog.""We'll get one on the way back.""All right. Have it your own way. Road to hell paved with unbought stuffed dogs. Not my fault."We went on."How'd you feel that way about dogs so sudden?""Always felt that way about dogs. Always been a great lover of stuffed animals."We stopped and had a drink."Certainly like to drink," Bill said. "You ought to try it some times, Jake.""You're about a hundred and forty-four ahead of me.""Ought not to daunt you. Never be daunted. Secret of my success. Never been daunted. Never been daunted in public.""Where were you drinking?""Stopped at the Crillon. George made me a couple of Jack Roses. George's a great man. Know the secret of his success? Never been daunted.""You'll be daunted after about three more pernods.""Not in public. If I begin to feel daunted I'll go off by myself. I'm like a cat that way.""When did you see Harvey Stone?""At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn't eaten for three days. Doesn't eat any more. Just goes off like a cat. Pretty sad.""He's all right.""Splendid. Wish he wouldn't keep going off like a cat, though. Makes me nervous.""What'll we do to-night?""Doesn't make any difference. Only let's not get daunted. Suppose they got any hard-boiled eggs here? If they had hard-boiled eggs here we wouldn't have to go all the way down to the island to eat.""Nix," I said. "We're going to have a regular meal.""Just a suggestion," said Bill. "Want to start now?""Come on."We started on again down the Boulevard. A horse-cab passed us. Bill looked at it."See that horse-cab? Going to have that horse-cab stuffed for you for Christmas. Going to give all my friends stuffed animals. I'm a nature-writer."A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop. The taxi backed up to the curb. In it was Brett."Beautiful lady," said Bill. "Going to kidnap us.""Hullo!" Brett said. "Hullo!""This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley."Brett smiled at Bill. "I say I'm just back. Haven't bathed even. Michael comes in to-night.""Good. Come on and eat with us, and we'll all go to meet him.""Must clean myself.""Oh, rot! Come on.""Must bathe. He doesn't get in till nine.""Come and have a drink, then, before you bathe.""Might do that. Now you're not talking rot."We got in the taxi. The driver looked around."Stop at the nearest bistro," I said."We might as well go to the Closerie," Brett said. "I can't drink these rotten brandies.""Closerie des Lilas."Brett turned to Bill."Have you been in this pestilential city long?""Just got in to-day from Budapest.""How was Budapest?""Wonderful. Budapest was wonderful.""Ask him about Vienna.""Vienna," said Bill, "is a strange city.""Very much like Paris," Brett smiled at him, wrinkling the corners of her eyes."Exactly," Bill said. "Very much like Paris at this moment.""You have a good start."Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and soda, I took one, too, and Bill took another pernod."How are you, Jake?""Great," I said. "I've had a good time."Brett looked at me. "I was a fool to go away," she said. "One's an ass to leave Paris.""Did you have a good time?""Oh, all right. Interesting. Not frightfully amusing.""See anybody?""No, hardly anybody. I never went out.""Didn't you swim?""No. Didn't do a thing.""Sounds like Vienna," Bill said.Brett wrinkled up the corners of her eyes at him."So that's the way it was in Vienna.""It was like everything in Vienna."Brett smiled at him again."You've a nice friend, Jake.""He's all right," I said. "He's a taxidermist.""That was in another country," Bill said. "And besides all the animals were dead.""One more," Brett said, "and I must run. Do send the waiter for a taxi.""There's a line of them. Right out in front.""Good."We had the drink and put Brett into her taxi."Mind you're at the Select around ten. Make him come. Michael will be there.""We'll be there," Bill said. The taxi started and Brett waved."Quite a girl," Bill said. "She's damned nice. Who's Michael?""The man she's going to marry.""Well, well," Bill said. "That's always just the stage I meet anybody. What'll I send them? Think they'd like a couple of stuffed race-horses?""We better eat.""Is she really Lady something or other?" Bill asked in the taxi on our way down to the Ile Saint Louis."Oh, yes. In the stud-book and everything.""Well, well."We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte's restaurant on the far side of the island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women's Club list as a quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte made a great fuss over seeing him."Doesn't get us a table, though," Bill said. "Grand woman, though."We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a salad, and some apple-pie and cheese."You've got the world here all right," Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She raised her hand. "Oh, my God!""You'll be rich.""I hope so."After the coffee and a fine we got the bill, chalked up the same as ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the "quaint" features, paid it, shook hands, and went out."You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes," Madame Lecomte said."Too many compatriots.""Come at lunch-time. It's not crowded then.""Good. I'll be down soon."We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai d'Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of old houses that were being torn down."They're going to cut a street through.""They would," Bill said.We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees were shadows."It's pretty grand," Bill said. "God, I love to get back."We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to the lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It made no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed us. They were walking with their arms around each other.We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking potato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in one hand."Want to have a drink?""No," said Bill. "I don't need it."We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth narrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the Boulevard du Port Royal."What do you want to do?" I asked. "Go up to the café and see Brett and Mike?""Why not?"We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on past the Lilas, Lavigne's, and all the little cafés, Damoy's, crossed the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.Michael came toward us from the tables. He was tanned and healthy-looking."Hel-lo, Jake," he said. "Hel-lo! Hel-lo! How are you, old lad?""You look very fit, Mike.""Oh, I am. I'm frightfully fit. I've done nothing but walk. Walk all day long. One drink a day with my mother at tea."Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was sitting on a high stool, her legs crossed. She had no stockings on."It's good to see you, Jake," Michael said. "I'm a little tight you know. Amazing, isn't it? Did you see my nose?"There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose."An old lady's bags did that," Mike said. "I reached up to help her with them and they fell on me."Brett gestured at him from the bar with her cigarette-holder and wrinkled the corners of her eyes."An old lady," said Mike. "Her bags fell on me. Let's go in and see Brett. I say, she is a piece. You are a lovely lady, Brett. Where did you get that hat?""Chap bought it for me. Don't you like it?""It's a dreadful hat. Do get a good hat.""Oh, we've so much money now," Brett said. "I say, haven't you met Bill yet? You are a lovely host, Jake."She turned to Mike. "This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike Campbell. Mr. Campbell is an undischarged bankrupt.""Aren't I, though? You know I met my ex-partner yesterday in London. Chap who did me in.""What did he say?""Bought me a drink. I thought I might as well take it. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece. Don't you think she's beautiful?""Beautiful. With this nose?""It's a lovely nose. Go on, point it at me. Isn't she a lovely piece?""Couldn't we have kept the man in Scotland?""I say, Brett, let's turn in early.""Don't be indecent, Michael. Remember there are ladies at this bar.""Isn't she a lovely piece? Don't you think so, Jake?""There's a fight to-night," Bill said. "Like to go?""Fight," said Mike. "Who's fighting?""Ledoux and somebody.""He's very good, Ledoux," Mike said. "I'd like to see it, rather"--he was making an effort to pull himself together--"but I can't go. I had a date with this thing here. I say, Brett, do get a new hat."Brett pulled the felt hat down far over one eye and smiled out from under it. "You two run along to the fight. I'll have to be taking Mr. Campbell home directly.""I'm not tight," Mike said. "Perhaps just a little. I say, Brett, you are a lovely piece.""Go on to the fight," Brett said. "Mr. Campbell's getting difficult. What are these outbursts of affection, Michael?""I say, you are a lovely piece."We said good night. "I'm sorry I can't go," Mike said. Brett laughed. I looked back from the door. Mike had one hand on the bar and was leaning toward Brett, talking. Brett was looking at him quite coolly, but the corners of her eyes were smiling.Outside on the pavement I said: "Do you want to go to the fight?""Sure," said Bill. "If we don't have to walk.""Mike was pretty excited about his girl friend," I said in the taxi."Well," said Bill. "You can't blame him such a hell of a lot."The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a good fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn, written from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing, playing some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he was anxious to start on the fishing-trip. When would I be down? If I would buy him a double-tapered line he would pay me when I came down.That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would leave Paris on the 25th unless I wired him otherwise, and would meet him at Bayonne, where we could get a bus over the mountains to Pamplona. The same evening about seven o'clock I stopped in at the Select to see Michael and Brett. They were not there, and I went over to the Dingo. They were inside sitting at the bar."Hello, darling." Brett put out her hand."Hello, Jake," Mike said. "I understand I was tight last night.""Weren't you, though," Brett said. "Disgraceful business.""Look," said Mike, "when do you go down to Spain? Would you mind if we came down with you?""It would be grand.""You wouldn't mind, really? I've been at Pamplona, you know. Brett's mad to go. You're sure we wouldn't just be a bloody nuisance?""Don't talk like a fool.""I'm a little tight, you know. I wouldn't ask you like this if I weren't. You're sure you don't mind?""Oh, shut up, Michael," Brett said. "How can the man say he'd mind now? I'll ask him later.""But you don't mind, do you?""Don't ask that again unless you want to make me sore. Bill and I go down on the morning of the 25th.""By the way, where is Bill?" Brett asked."He's out at Chantilly dining with some people.""He's a good chap.""Splendid chap," said Mike. "He is, you know.""You don't remember him," Brett said."I do. Remember him perfectly. Look, Jake, we'll come down the night of the 25th. Brett can't get up in the morning.""Indeed not!""If our money comes and you're sure you don't mind.""It will come, all right. I'll see to that.""Tell me what tackle to send for.""Get two or three rods with reels, and lines, and some flies.""I won't fish," Brett put in."Get two rods, then, and Bill won't have to buy one.""Right," said Mike. "I'll send a wire to the keeper.""Won't it be splendid," Brett said. "Spain! We will have fun.""The 25th. When is that?""Saturday.""We will have to get ready.""I say," said Mike, "I'm going to the barber's.""I must bathe," said Brett. "Walk up to the hotel with me, Jake. Be a good chap.""We have got the loveliest hotel," Mike said. "I think it's a brothel!""We left our bags here at the Dingo when we got in, and they asked us at this hotel if we wanted a room for the afternoon only. Seemed frightfully pleased we were going to stay all night.""I believe it's a brothel," Mike said. "And I should know.""Oh, shut it and go and get your hair cut."Mike went out. Brett and I sat on at the bar."Have another?""Might.""I needed that," Brett said.We walked up the Rue Delambre."I haven't seen you since I've been back," Brett said."No.""How are you, Jake?""Fine."Brett looked at me. "I say," she said, "is Robert Cohn going on this trip?""Yes. Why?""Don't you think it will be a bit rough on him?""Why should it?""Who did you think I went down to San Sebastian with?""Congratulations," I said.We walked along."What did you say that for?""I don't know. What would you like me to say?"We walked along and turned a corner."He behaved rather well, too. He gets a little dull.""Does he?""I rather thought it would be good for him.""You might take up social service.""Don't be nasty.""I won't.""Didn't you really know?""No," I said. "I guess I didn't think about it.""Do you think it will be too rough on him?""That's up to him," I said. "Tell him you're coming. He can always not come.""I'll write him and give him a chance to pull out of it."I did not see Brett again until the night of the 24th of June."Did you hear from Cohn?""Rather. He's keen about it.""My God!""I thought it was rather odd myself.""Says he can't wait to see me.""Does he think you're coming alone?""No. I told him we were all coming down together. Michael and all.""He's wonderful.""Isn't he?"They expected their money the next day. We arranged to meet at Pamplona. They would go directly to San Sebastian and take the train from there. We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the mountains, to start fishing. There was a bus to Burguete. I wrote out an itinerary so they could follow us.Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d'Orsay. It was a lovely day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went back into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked the conductor for tickets for the first service."Nothing until the fifth.""What's this?"There were never more than two servings of lunch on that train, and always plenty of places for both of them."They're all reserved," the dining-car conductor said. "There will be a fifth service at three-thirty.""This is serious," I said to Bill."Give him ten francs.""Here," I said. "We want to eat in the first service."The conductor put the ten francs in his pocket."Thank you," he said. "I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches. All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company.""You'll go a long way, brother," Bill said to him in English. "I suppose if I'd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train.""Comment?""Go to hell!" said Bill. "Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine. You tell him, Jake.""And send it up to the next car." I described where we were.In our compartment were a man and his wife and their young son."I suppose you're Americans, aren't you?" the man asked. "Having a good trip?""Wonderful," said Bill."That's what you want to do. Travel while you're young. Mother and I always wanted to get over, but we had to wait a while.""You could have come over ten years ago, if you'd wanted to," the wife said. "What you always said was: 'See America first!' I will say we've seen a good deal, take it one way and another.""Say, there's plenty of Americans on this train," the husband said. "They've got seven cars of them from Dayton, Ohio. They've been on a pilgrimage to Rome, and now they're going down to Biarritz and Lourdes.""So, that's what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans," Bill said."What part of the States you boys from?""Kansas City," I said. "He's from Chicago.""You both going to Biarritz?""No. We're going fishing in Spain.""Well, I never cared for it, myself. There's plenty that do out where I come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana. I've been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.""Mighty little fishing you did on them trips," his wife said.He winked at us."You know how the ladies are. If there's a jug goes along, or a case of beer, they think it's hell and damnation.""That's the way men are," his wife said to us. She smoothed her comfortable lap. "I voted against prohibition to please him, and because I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It's a wonder they ever find any one to marry them.""Say," said Bill, "do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?""How do you mean? They can't do a thing like that.""You try and get seats.""Well, mother, it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast."She stood up and straightened her dress."Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert."They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in."You're going to work to-day," I said.He nodded his head. "They start now, at ten-thirty.""When do we eat?""Huh! When do I eat?"He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches and tipped him."I'll get the plates," he said, "or bring them with you."We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees, and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably."Is there good swimming in Biarritz?" asked Hubert."That boy's just crazy till he can get in the water," his mother said. "It's pretty hard on youngsters travelling.""There's good swimming," I said. "But it's dangerous when it's rough.""Did you get a meal?" Bill asked."We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.""They thought we were snappers, all right," the man said. "It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It's a pity you boys ain't Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.""I am," I said. "That's what makes me so sore."Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather difficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims."When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?""I don't know anything about it. Haven't you got tickets?""It's enough to make a man join the Klan," Bill said. The priest looked back at him.Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table d'hôte meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white jacket was purple under the arms."He must drink a lot of wine.""Or wear purple undershirts.""Let's ask him.""No. He's too tired."The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town. Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the window, and about nine o'clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to change for Biarritz."Well, I hope you have lots of luck," he said."Be careful about those bull-fights.""Maybe we'll see you at Biarritz," Hubert said.We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses. There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see us at first. Then he started forward."Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?""Fine," I said. "This is Bill Gorton.""How are you?""Come on," said Robert. "I've got a cab." He was a little near-sighted. I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make him out. He was shy, too."We'll go up to my hotel. It's all right. It's quite nice."We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark bridge and into the town."I'm awfully glad to meet you," Robert said to Bill. "I've heard so much about you from Jake and I've read your books. Did you get my line, Jake?"The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we each had a good small room.In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of the town, and we all had breakfast in a café. Bayonne is a nice town. It is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.I was not at all sure Mike's rods would come from Scotland in time, so we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs over a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had to wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn made some remark about it being a very good example of something or other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim, like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the local Syndicat d'Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot, but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant sitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the café. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big, closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs, and we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we started off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and villages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back toward the sea. You couldn't see the sea. It was too far away. You could see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge, and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in kepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in and looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of the line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any trout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it did not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not many.I asked him if he ever fished, and he said no, that he didn't care for it.Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain."What's the matter with the old one?" I asked."He hasn't got any passport."I offered the guard a cigarette. He took it and thanked me."What will he do?" I asked.The guard spat in the dust."Oh, he'll just wade across the stream.""Do you have much smuggling?""Oh," he said, "they go through."The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest, and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and shifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head. Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of the other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside the old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the square. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the second floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early in the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in Spain was always a shock with the hors d'oeuvres, an egg course, two meat courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink plenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him, and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate of cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward."Well," I said, "Brett and Mike ought to get in to-night.""I'm not sure they'll come," Cohn said."Why not?" Bill said. "Of course they'll come.""They're always late," I said."I rather think they're not coming," Robert Cohn said.He said it with an air of superior knowledge that irritated both of us."I'll bet you fifty pesetas they're here to-night," Bill said. He always bets when he is angered, and so he usually bets foolishly."I'll take it," Cohn said. "Good. You remember it, Jake. Fifty pesetas.""I'll remember it myself," Bill said. I saw he was angry and wanted to smooth him down."It's a sure thing they'll come," I said. "But maybe not to-night.""Want to call it off?" Cohn asked."No. Why should I? Make it a hundred if you like.""All right. I'll take that.""That's enough," I said. "Or you'll have to make a book and give me some of it.""I'm satisfied," Cohn said. He smiled. "You'll probably win it back at bridge, anyway.""You haven't got it yet," Bill said.We went out to walk around under the arcade to the Café Iruña for coffee. Cohn said he was going over and get a shave."Say," Bill said to me, "have I got any chance on that bet?""You've got a rotten chance. They've never been on time anywhere. If their money doesn't come it's a cinch they won't get in to-night.""I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth. But I had to call him. He's all right, I guess, but where does he get this inside stuff? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here."I saw Cohn coming over across the square."Here he comes.""Well, let him not get superior and Jewish.""The barber shop's closed," Cohn said. "It's not open till four."We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to brush off my coat."You must have been in a motor-car," he said.The back of the collar and the upper part of the shoulders were gray with dust."From Bayonne.""Well, well," he said. "I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the dust was." So I gave him two copper coins.At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it. The first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked it now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count, and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn't seen him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while, and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair afterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to help him any. The train was due in at nine o'clock from San Sebastian, and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave his dinner. I said we would be right back.We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn's nervousness. I hoped Brett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn--nor as eager. I was enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a wonderful quality of bringing out the worst in anybody.After a while we heard the train-whistle way off below on the other side of the plateau, and then we saw the headlight coming up the hill. We went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of the gates, and the train came in and stopped, and everybody started coming out through the gates.They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through and out of the station and gotten into buses, or taken cabs, or were walking with their friends or relatives through the dark into the town."I knew they wouldn't come," Robert said. We were going back to the hotel."I thought they might," I said.Bill was eating fruit when we came in and finishing a bottle of wine."Didn't come, eh?""No.""Do you mind if I give you that hundred pesetas in the morning, Cohn?" Bill asked. "I haven't changed any money here yet.""Oh, forget about it," Robert Cohn said. "Let's bet on something else. Can you bet on bull-fights?""You could," Bill said, "but you don't need to.""It would be like betting on the war," I said. "You don't need any economic interest.""I'm very curious to see them," Robert said.Montoya came up to our table. He had a telegram in his hand. "It's for you." He handed it to me.It read: "Stopped night San Sebastian.""It's from them," I said. I put it in my pocket. Ordinarily I should have handed it over."They've stopped over in San Sebastian," I said. "Send their regards to you."Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know. I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact that I took it as a matter of course did not alter that any. I certainly did hate him. I do not think I ever really hated him until he had that little spell of superiority at lunch--that and when he went through all that barbering. So I put the telegram in my pocket. The telegram came to me, anyway."Well," I said. "We ought to pull out on the noon bus for Burguete. They can follow us if they get in to-morrow night."There were only two trains up from San Sebastian, an early morning train and the one we had just met."That sounds like a good idea," Cohn said."The sooner we get on the stream the better.""It's all one to me when we start," Bill said. "The sooner the better."We sat in the Iruña for a while and had coffee and then took a little walk out to the bull-ring and across the field and under the trees at the edge of the cliff and looked down at the river in the dark, and I turned in early. Bill and Cohn stayed out in the café quite late, I believe, because I was asleep when they came in.In the morning I bought three tickets for the bus to Burguete. It was scheduled to leave at two o'clock. There was nothing earlier. I was sitting over at the Iruña reading the papers when I saw Robert Cohn coming across the square. He came up to the table and sat down in one of the wicker chairs."This is a comfortable café," he said. "Did you have a good night, Jake?""I slept like a log.""I didn't sleep very well. Bill and I were out late, too.""Where were you?""Here. And after it shut we went over to that other café. The old man there speaks German and English.""The Café Suizo.""That's it. He seems like a nice old fellow. I think it's a better café than this one.""It's not so good in the daytime," I said. "Too hot. By the way, I got the bus tickets.""I'm not going up to-day. You and Bill go on ahead.""I've got your ticket.""Give it to me. I'll get the money back.""It's five pesetas."Robert Cohn took out a silver five-peseta piece and gave it to me."I ought to stay," he said. "You see I'm afraid there's some sort of misunderstanding.""Why," I said. "They may not come here for three or four days now if they start on parties at San Sebastian.""That's just it," said Robert. "I'm afraid they expected to meet me at San Sebastian, and that's why they stopped over.""What makes you think that?""Well, I wrote suggesting it to Brett.""Why in hell didn't you stay there and meet them then?" I started to say, but I stopped. I thought that idea would come to him by itself, but I do not believe it ever did.He was being confidential now and it was giving him pleasure to be able to talk with the understanding that I knew there was something between him and Brett."Well, Bill and I will go up right after lunch," I said."I wish I could go. We've been looking forward to this fishing all winter." He was being sentimental about it. "But I ought to stay. I really ought. As soon as they come I'll bring them right up.""Let's find Bill.""I want to go over to the barber-shop.""See you at lunch."I found Bill up in his room. He was shaving."Oh, yes, he told me all about it last night," Bill said. "He's a great little confider. He said he had a date with Brett at San Sebastian.""The lying bastard!""Oh, no," said Bill. "Don't get sore. Don't get sore at this stage of the trip. How did you ever happen to know this fellow, anyway?""Don't rub it in."Bill looked around, half-shaved, and then went on talking into the mirror while he lathered his face."Didn't you send him with a letter to me in New York last winter? Thank God, I'm a travelling man. Haven't you got some more Jewish friends you could bring along?" He rubbed his chin with his thumb, looked at it, and then started scraping again."You've got some fine ones yourself.""Oh, yes. I've got some darbs. But not alongside of this Robert Cohn. The funny thing is he's nice, too. I like him. But he's just so awful.""He can be damn nice.""I know it. That's the terrible part."I laughed."Yes. Go on and laugh," said Bill. "You weren't out with him last night until two o'clock.""Was he very bad?""Awful. What's all this about him and Brett, anyway? Did she ever have anything to do with him?"He raised his chin up and pulled it from side to side."Sure. She went down to San Sebastian with him.""What a damn-fool thing to do. Why did she do that?""She wanted to get out of town and she can't go anywhere alone. She said she thought it would be good for him.""What bloody-fool things people do. Why didn't she go off with some of her own people? Or you?"--he slurred that over--"or me? Why not me?" He looked at his face carefully in the glass, put a big dab of lather on each cheek-bone. "It's an honest face. It's a face any woman would be safe with.""She'd never seen it.""She should have. All women should see it. It's a face that ought to be thrown on every screen in the country. Every woman ought to be given a copy of this face as she leaves the altar. Mothers should tell their daughters about this face. My son"--he pointed the razor at me--"go west with this face and grow up with the country."He ducked down to the bowl, rinsed his face with cold water, put on some alcohol, and then looked at himself carefully in the glass, pulling down his long upper lip."My God!" he said, "isn't it an awful face?"He looked in the glass."And as for this Robert Cohn," Bill said, "he makes me sick, and he can go to hell, and I'm damn glad he's staying here so we won't have him fishing with us.""You're damn right.""We're going trout-fishing. We're going trout-fishing in the Irati River, and we're going to get tight now at lunch on the wine of the country, and then take a swell bus ride.""Come on. Let's go over to the Iruña and start," I said.It was baking hot in the square when we came out after lunch with our bags and the rod-case to go to Burguete. People were on top of the bus, and others were climbing up a ladder. Bill went up and Robert sat beside Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and I fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top.Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us start. A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it. The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They were peasants going up into the hills.Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert Cohn waved good-by to us, and all the Basques waved good-by to him. As soon as we started out on the road outside of town it was cool. It felt nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the wine-bottle, and winked at us. He nodded his head."Pretty nice, eh?""These Basques are swell people," Bill said.The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather. He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his tanned neck. He turned around and offered his wine-bag to Bill. Bill handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and handed the bottle back, slapping in the cork with the palm of his hand. He shoved the wine-bag up."Arriba! Arriba!" he said. "Lift it up."Bill raised the wine-skin and let the stream of wine spurt out and into his mouth, his head tipped back. When he stopped drinking and tipped the leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin."No! No!" several Basques said. "Not like that." One snatched the bottle away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms' length and raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing smoothly and regularly."Hey!" the owner of the bottle shouted. "Whose wine is that?"The drinker waggled his little finger at him and smiled at us with his eyes. Then he bit the stream off sharp, made a quick lift with the wine-bag and lowered it down to the owner. He winked at us. The owner shook the wine-skin sadly.We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and fields of grapes touched the houses.The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were shelves stacked with supplies and goods.We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus. There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we started off.The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English: "You're Americans?""Sure.""I been there," he said. "Forty years ago."He was an old man, as brown as the others, with the stubble of a white beard."How was it?""What you say?""How was America?""Oh, I was in California. It was fine.""Why did you leave?""What you say?""Why did you come back here?""Oh! I come back to get married. I was going to go back but my wife she don't like to travel. Where you from?""Kansas City.""I been there," he said. "I been in Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City."He named them carefully."How long were you over?""Fifteen years. Then I come back and got married.""Have a drink?""All right," he said. "You can't get this in America, eh?""There's plenty if you can pay for it.""What you come over here for?""We're going to the fiesta at Pamplona.""You like the bull-fights?""Sure. Don't you?""Yes," he said. "I guess I like them."Then after a little:"Where you go now?""Up to Burguete to fish.""Well," he said, "I hope you catch something."He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of the monastery of Roncesvalles."There's Roncevaux," I said."Where?""Way off there where the mountain starts.""It's cold up here," Bill said."It's high," I said. "It must be twelve hundred metres.""It's awful cold," Bill said.The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no side-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps came up."What's in there?" he pointed to the rod-case.I opened it and showed him. He asked to see our fishing permits and I got them out. He looked at the date and then waved us on."Is that all right?" I asked."Yes. Of course."We went up the street, past the whitewashed stone houses, families sitting in their doorways watching us, to the inn.The fat woman who ran the inn came out from the kitchen and shook hands with us. She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and put them on again. It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The woman sent a girl up-stairs with us to show the room. There were two beds, a washstand, a clothes-chest, and a big, framed steel-engraving of Nuestra Señora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the shutters. The room was on the north side of the inn. We washed, put on sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone floor, low ceiling, and was oak-panelled. The shutters were up and it was so cold you could see your breath."My God!" said Bill. "It can't be this cold to-morrow. I'm not going to wade a stream in this weather."There was an upright piano in the far corner of the room beyond the wooden tables and Bill went over and started to play."I got to keep warm," he said.I went out to find the woman and ask her how much the room and board was. She put her hands under her apron and looked away from me."Twelve pesetas.""Why, we only paid that in Pamplona."She did not say anything, just took off her glasses and wiped them on her apron."That's too much," I said. "We didn't pay more than that at a big hotel.""We've put in a bathroom.""Haven't you got anything cheaper?""Not in the summer. Now is the big season."We were the only people in the inn. Well, I thought, it's only a few days."Is the wine included?""Oh, yes.""Well," I said. "It's all right."I went back to Bill. He blew his breath at me to show how cold it was, and went on playing. I sat at one of the tables and looked at the pictures on the wall. There was one panel of rabbits, dead, one of pheasants, also dead, and one panel of dead ducks. The panels were all dark and smoky-looking. There was a cupboard full of liqueur bottles. I looked at them all. Bill was still playing. "How about a hot rum punch?" he said. "This isn't going to keep me warm permanently."I went out and told the woman what a rum punch was and how to make it. In a few minutes a girl brought a stone pitcher, steaming, into the room. Bill came over from the piano and we drank the hot punch and listened to the wind."There isn't too much rum in that."I went over to the cupboard and brought the rum bottle and poured a half-tumblerful into the pitcher."Direct action," said Bill. "It beats legislation."The girl came in and laid the table for supper."It blows like hell up here," Bill said.The girl brought in a big bowl of hot vegetable soup and the wine. We had fried trout afterward and some sort of a stew and a big bowl full of wild strawberries. We did not lose money on the wine, and the girl was shy but nice about bringing it The old woman looked in once and counted the empty bottles.After supper we went up-stairs and smoked and read in bed to keep warm. Once in the night I woke and heard the wind blowing. It felt good to be warm and in bed.When I woke in the morning I went to the window and looked out. It had cleared and there were no clouds on the mountains. Outside under the window were some carts and an old diligence, the wood of the roof cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to the roof of the diligence. He jerked his head at the other goats below and when I waved at him he bounded down.Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the hall, and went down-stairs. No one was stirring down-stairs, so I unbolted the door and went out. It was cool outside in the early morning and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died down. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for bait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and loosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many. Digging at the edge of the damp ground I filled two empty tobacco-tins with worms and sifted dirt onto them. The goats watched me dig.When I went back into the inn the woman was down in the kitchen, and I asked her to get coffee for us, and that we wanted a lunch. Bill was awake and sitting on the edge of the bed."I saw you out of the window," he said. "Didn't want to interrupt you. What were you doing? Burying your money?""You lazy bum!""Been working for the common good? Splendid. I want you to do that every morning.""Come on," I said. "Get up.""What? Get up? I never get up."He climbed into bed and pulled the sheet up to his chin."Try and argue me into getting up."I went on looking for the tackle and putting it all together in the tackle-bag."Aren't you interested?" Bill asked."I'm going down and eat.""Eat? Why didn't you say eat? I thought you just wanted me to get up for fun. Eat? Fine. Now you're reasonable. You go out and dig some more worms and I'll be right down.""Oh, go to hell!""Work for the good of all." Bill stepped into his underclothes. "Show irony and pity."I started out of the room with the tackle-bag, the nets, and the rod-case."Hey! come back!"I put my head in the door."Aren't you going to show a little irony and pity?"I thumbed my nose."That's not irony."As I went down-stairs I heard Bill singing, "Irony and Pity. When you're feeling ... Oh, Give them Irony and Give them Pity. Oh, give them Irony. When they're feeling ... Just a little irony. Just a little pity ..." He kept on singing until he came down-stairs. The tune was: "The Bells are Ringing for Me and my Gal." I was reading a week-old Spanish paper."What's all this irony and pity?""What? Don't you know about Irony and Pity?""No. Who got it up?""Everybody. They're mad about it in New York. It's just like the Fratellinis used to be."The girl came in with the coffee and buttered toast. Or, rather, it was bread toasted and buttered."Ask her if she's got any jam," Bill said. "Be ironical with her.""Have you got any jam?""That's not ironical. I wish I could talk Spanish."The coffee was good and we drank it out of big bowls. The girl brought in a glass dish of raspberry jam."Thank you.""Hey! that's not the way," Bill said. "Say something ironical. Make some crack about Primo de Rivera.""I could ask her what kind of a jam they think they've gotten into in the Riff.""Poor," said Bill. "Very poor. You can't do it. That's all. You don't understand irony. You have no pity. Say something pitiful.""Robert Cohn.""Not so bad. That's better. Now why is Cohn pitiful? Be ironic."He took a big gulp of coffee."Aw, hell!" I said. "It's too early in the morning.""There you go. And you claim you want to be a writer, too. You're only a newspaper man. An expatriated newspaper man. You ought to be ironical the minute you get out of bed. You ought to wake up with your mouth full of pity.""Go on," I said. "Who did you get this stuff from?""Everybody. Don't you read? Don't you ever see anybody? You know what you are? You're an expatriate. Why don't you live in New York? Then you'd know these things. What do you want me to do? Come over here and tell you every year?""Take some more coffee," I said."Good. Coffee is good for you. It's the caffeine in it. Caffeine, we are here. Caffeine puts a man on her horse and a woman in his grave. You know what's the trouble with you? You're an expatriate. One of the worst type. Haven't you heard that? Nobody that ever left their own country ever wrote anything worth printing. Not even in the newspapers."He drank the coffee."You're an expatriate. You've lost touch with the soil. You get precious. Fake European standards have ruined you. You drink yourself to death. You become obsessed by sex. You spend all your time talking, not working. You are an expatriate, see? You hang around cafés.""It sounds like a swell life," I said. "When do I work?""You don't work. One group claims women support you. Another group claims you're impotent.""No," I said. "I just had an accident.""Never mention that," Bill said. "That's the sort of thing that can't be spoken of. That's what you ought to work up into a mystery. Like Henry's bicycle."He had been going splendidly, but he stopped. I was afraid he thought he had hurt me with that crack about being impotent. I wanted to start him again."It wasn't a bicycle," I said. "He was riding horseback.""I heard it was a tricycle.""Well," I said. "A plane is sort of like a tricycle. The joystick works the same way.""But you don't pedal it.""No," I said, "I guess you don't pedal it.""Let's lay off that," Bill said."All right. I was just standing up for the tricycle.""I think he's a good writer, too," Bill said. "And you're a hell of a good guy. Anybody ever tell you you were a good guy?""I'm not a good guy.""Listen. You're a hell of a good guy, and I'm fonder of you than anybody on earth. I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot. That was what the Civil War was about. Abraham Lincoln was a faggot. He was in love with General Grant. So was Jefferson Davis. Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet. The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti-Saloon League. Sex explains it all. The Colonel's Lady and Judy O'Grady are Lesbians under their skin."He stopped."Want to hear some more?""Shoot," I said."I don't know any more. Tell you some more at lunch.""Old Bill," I said."You bum!"We packed the lunch and two bottles of wine in the rucksack, and Bill put it on. I carried the rod-case and the landing-nets slung over my back. We started up the road and then went across a meadow and found a path that crossed the fields and went toward the woods on the slope of the first hill. We walked across the fields on the sandy path. The fields were rolling and grassy and the grass was short from the sheep grazing. The cattle were up in the hills. We heard their bells in the woods.The path crossed a stream on a foot-log. The log was surfaced off, and there was a sapling bent across for a rail. In the flat pool beside the stream tadpoles spotted the sand. We went up a steep bank and across the rolling fields. Looking back we saw Burguete, white houses and red roofs, and the white road with a truck going along it and the dust rising.Beyond the fields we crossed another faster-flowing stream. A sandy road led down to the ford and beyond into the woods. The path crossed the stream on another foot-log below the ford, and joined the road, and we went into the woods.It was a beech wood and the trees were very old. Their roots bulked above the ground and the branches were twisted. We walked on the road between the thick trunks of the old beeches and the sunlight came through the leaves in light patches on the grass. The trees were big, and the foliage was thick but it was not gloomy. There was no undergrowth, only the smooth grass, very green and fresh, and the big gray trees well spaced as though it were a park."This is country," Bill said.The road went up a hill and we got into thick woods, and the road kept on climbing. Sometimes it dipped down but rose again steeply. All the time we heard the cattle in the woods. Finally, the road came out on the top of the hills. We were on the top of the height of land that was the highest part of the range of wooded hills we had seen from Burguete. There were wild strawberries growing on the sunny side of the ridge in a little clearing in the trees.Ahead the road came out of the forest and went along the shoulder of the ridge of hills. The hills ahead were not wooded, and there were great fields of yellow gorse. Way off we saw the steep bluffs, dark with trees and jutting with gray stone, that marked the course of the Irati River."We have to follow this road along the ridge, cross these hills, go through the woods on the far hills, and come down to the Irati valley," I pointed out to Bill."That's a hell of a hike.""It's too far to go and fish and come back the same day, comfortably.""Comfortably. That's a nice word. We'll have to go like hell to get there and back and have any fishing at all."It was a long walk and the country was very fine, but we were tired when we came down the steep road that led out of the wooded hills into the valley of the Rio de la Fabrica.The road came out from the shadow of the woods into the hot sun. Ahead was a river-valley. Beyond the river was a steep hill. There was a field of buckwheat on the hill. We saw a white house under some trees on the hillside. It was very hot and we stopped under some trees beside a dam that crossed the river.Bill put the pack against one of the trees and we jointed up the rods, put on the reels, tied on leaders, and got ready to fish."You're sure this thing has trout in it?" Bill asked."It's full of them.""I'm going to fish a fly. You got any McGintys?""There's some in there.""You going to fish bait?""Yeah. I'm going to fish the dam here.""Well, I'll take the fly-book, then." He tied on a fly. "Where'd I better go? Up or down?""Down is the best. They're plenty up above, too."Bill went down the bank."Take a worm can.""No, I don't want one. If they won't take a fly I'll just flick it around."Bill was down below watching the stream."Say," he called up against the noise of the dam. "How about putting the wine in that spring up the road?""All right," I shouted. Bill waved his hand and started down the stream. I found the two wine-bottles in the pack, and carried them up the road to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my hand and wrist felt numbed. I put back the slab of wood, and hoped nobody would find the wine.I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and landing-net, and walked out onto the dam. It was built to provide a head of water for driving logs. The gate was up, and I sat on one of the squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was deep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the falls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into the water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and dropped into the white water close to the edge of the timbers of the dam.I did not feel the first trout strike. When I started to pull up I felt that I had one and brought him, fighting and bending the rod almost double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him up and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into my bag.While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the same way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same size. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same way, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard from the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked out the insides, gills and all, and tossed them over across the river. I took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water above the dam, and then picked some ferns and packed them all in the bag, three trout on a layer of ferns, then another layer of fems, then three more trout, and then covered them with ferns. They looked nice in the ferns, and now the bag was bulky, and I put it in the shade of the tree.It was very hot on the dam, so I put my worm-can in the shade with the bag, and got a book out of the pack and settled down under the tree to read until Bill should come up for lunch.It was a little past noon and there was not much shade, but I sat against the trunk of two of the trees that grew together, and read. The book was something by A. E. W. Mason, and I was reading a wonderful story about a man who had been frozen in the Alps and then fallen into a glacier and disappeared, and his bride was going to wait twenty-four years exactly for his body to come out on the moraine, while her true love waited too, and they were still waiting when Bill came up."Get any?" he asked. He had his rod and his bag and his net all in one hand, and he was sweating. I hadn't heard him come up, because of the noise from the dam."Six. What did you get?"Bill sat down, opened up his bag, laid a big trout on the grass. He took out three more, each one a little bigger than the last, and laid them side by side in the shade from the tree. His face was sweaty and happy."How are yours?""Smaller.""Let's see them.""They're packed.""How big are they really?""They're all about the size of your smallest.""You're not holding out on me?""I wish I were.""Get them all on worms?""Yes.""You lazy bum!"Bill put the trout in the bag and started for the river, swinging the open bag. He was wet from the waist down and I knew he must have been wading the stream.I walked up the road and got out the two bottles of wine. They were cold. Moisture beaded on the bottles as I walked back to the trees. I spread the lunch on a newspaper, and uncorked one of the bottles and leaned the other against a tree. Bill came up drying his hands, his bag plump with ferns."Let's see that bottle," he said. He pulled the cork, and tipped up the bottle and drank. "Whew! That makes my eyes ache.""Let's try it."The wine was icy cold and tasted faintly rusty."That's not such filthy wine," Bill said."The cold helps it," I said.We unwrapped the little parcels of lunch."Chicken.""There's hard-boiled eggs.""Find any salt?""First the egg," said Bill. "Then the chicken. Even Bryan could see that.""He's dead. I read it in the paper yesterday.""No. Not really?""Yes. Bryan's dead."Bill laid down the egg he was peeling."Gentlemen," he said, and unwrapped a drumstick from a piece of newspaper. "I reverse the order. For Bryan's sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.""Wonder what day God created the chicken?""Oh," said Bill, sucking the drumstick, "how should we know? We should not question. Our stay on earth is not for long. Let us rejoice and believe and give thanks.""Eat an egg."Bill gestured with the drumstick in one hand and the bottle of wine in the other."Let us rejoice in our blessings. Let us utilize the fowls of the air. Let us utilize the product of the vine. Will you utilize a little, brother?""After you, brother."Bill took a long drink."Utilize a little, brother," he handed me the bottle. "Let us not doubt, brother. Let us not pry into the holy mysteries of the hen-coop with simian fingers. Let us accept on faith and simply say--I want you to join with me in saying--What shall we say, brother?" He pointed the drumstick at me and went on. "Let me tell you. We will say, and I for one am proud to say--and I want you to say with me, on your knees, brother. Let no man be ashamed to kneel here in the great out-of-doors. Remember the woods were God's first temples. Let us kneel and say: 'Don't eat that, Lady--that's Mencken.'""Here," I said. "Utilize a little of this."We uncorked the other bottle."What's the matter?" I said. "Didn't you like Bryan?""I loved Bryan," said Bill. "We were like brothers.""Where did you know him?""He and Mencken and I all went to Holy Cross together.""And Frankie Fritsch.""It's a lie. Frankie Fritsch went to Fordham.""Well," I said, "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning.""It's a lie," Bill said. "I went to Loyola with Bishop Manning myself.""You're cock-eyed," I said."On wine?""Why not?""It's the humidity," Bill said. "They ought to take this damn humidity away.""Have another shot.""Is this all we've got?""Only the two bottles.""Do you know what you are?" Bill looked at the bottle affectionately."No," I said."You're in the pay of the Anti-Saloon League.""I went to Notre Dame with Wayne B. Wheeler.""It's a lie," said Bill. "I went to Austin Business College with Wayne B. Wheeler. He was class president.""Well," I said, "the saloon must go.""You're right there, old classmate," Bill said. "The saloon must go, and I will take it with me.""You're cock-eyed.""On wine?""On wine.""Well, maybe I am.""Want to take a nap?""All right."We lay with our heads in the shade and looked up into the trees."You asleep?""No," Bill said. "I was thinking."I shut my eyes. It felt good lying on the ground."Say," Bill said, "what about this Brett business?""What about it?""Were you ever in love with her?""Sure.""For how long?""Off and on for a hell of a long time.""Oh, hell!" Bill said. "I'm sorry, fella.""It's all right," I said. "I don't give a damn any more.""Really?""Really. Only I'd a hell of a lot rather not talk about it.""You aren't sore I asked you?""Why the hell should I be?""I'm going to sleep," Bill said. He put a newspaper over his face."Listen, Jake," he said, "are you really a Catholic?""Technically.""What does that mean?""I don't know.""All right, I'll go to sleep now," he said. "Don't keep me awake by talking so much."I went to sleep, too. When I woke up Bill was packing the rucksack. It was late in the afternoon and the shadow from the trees was long and went out over the dam. I was stiff from sleeping on the ground."What did you do? Wake up?" Bill asked. "Why didn't you spend the night?" I stretched and rubbed my eyes."I had a lovely dream," Bill said. "I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream.""I don't think I dreamt.""You ought to dream," Bill said. "All our biggest business men have been dreamers. Look at Ford. Look at President Coolidge. Look at Rockefeller. Look at Jo Davidson."I disjointed my rod and Bill's and packed them in the rod-case. I put the reels in the tackle-bag. Bill had packed the rucksack and we put one of the trout-bags in. I carried the other."Well," said Bill, "have we got everything?""The worms.""Your worms. Put them in there."He had the pack on his back and I put the worm-cans in one of the outside flap pockets."You got everything now?"I looked around on the grass at the foot of the elm-trees."Yes."We started up the road into the woods. It was a long walk home to Burguete, and it was dark when we came down across the fields to the road, and along the road between the houses of the town, their windows lighted, to the inn.We stayed five days at Burguete and had good fishing. The nights were cold and the days were hot, and there was always a breeze even in the heat of the day. It was hot enough so that it felt good to wade in a cold stream, and the sun dried you when you came out and sat on the bank. We found a stream with a pool deep enough to swim in. In the evenings we played three-handed bridge with an Englishman named Harris, who had walked over from Saint Jean Pied de Port and was stopping at the inn for the fishing. He was very pleasant and went with us twice to the Irati River. There was no word from Robert Cohn nor from Brett and Mike.One morning I went down to breakfast and the Englishman, Harris, was already at the table. He was reading the paper through spectacles. He looked up and smiled."Good morning," he said. "Letter for you. I stopped at the post and they gave it me with mine."The letter was at my place at the table, leaning against a coffee-cup. Harris was reading the paper again. I opened the letter. It had been forwarded from Pamplona. It was dated San Sebastian, Sunday:"What day of the week is it?" I asked Harris."Wednesday, I think. Yes, quite. Wednesday. Wonderful how one loses track of the days up here in the mountains.""Yes. We've been here nearly a week.""I hope you're not thinking of leaving?""Yes. We'll go in on the afternoon bus, I'm afraid.""What a rotten business. I had hoped we'd all have another go at the Irati together.""We have to go into Pamplona. We're meeting people there.""What rotten luck for me. We've had a jolly time here at Burguete.""Come on in to Pamplona. We can play some bridge there, and there's going to be a damned fine fiesta.""I'd like to. Awfully nice of you to ask me. I'd best stop on here, though. I've not much more time to fish.""You want those big ones in the Irati.""I say, I do, you know. They're enormous trout there.""I'd like to try them once more.""Do. Stop over another day. Be a good chap.""We really have to get into town," I said."What a pity."After breakfast Bill and I were sitting warming in the sun on a bench out in front of the inn and talking it over. I saw a girl coming up the road from the centre of the town. She stopped in front of us and took a telegram out of the leather wallet that hung against her skirt."Por ustedes?"I looked at it. The address was: "Barnes, Burguete.""Yes. It's for us."She brought out a book for me to sign, and I gave her a couple of coppers. The telegram was in Spanish: "Vengo Jueves Cohn."I handed it to Bill."What does the word Cohn mean?" he asked."What a lousy telegram!" I said. "He could send ten words for the same price. 'I come Thursday.' That gives you a lot of dope, doesn't it?""It gives you all the dope that's of interest to Cohn.""We're going in, anyway," I said. "There's no use trying to move Brett and Mike out here and back before the fiesta. Should we answer it?""We might as well," said Bill. "There's no need for us to be snooty."We walked up to the post-office and asked for a telegraph blank."What will we say?" Bill asked."'Arriving to-night.' That's enough."We paid for the message and walked back to the inn. Harris was there and the three of us walked up to Roncesvalles. We went through the monastery."It's a remarkable place," Harris said, when we came out. "But you know I'm not much on those sort of places.""Me either," Bill said."It's a remarkable place, though," Harris said. "I wouldn't not have seen it. I'd been intending coming up each day.""It isn't the same as fishing, though, is it?" Bill asked. He liked Harris."I say not."We were standing in front of the old chapel of the monastery."Isn't that a pub across the way?" Harris asked. "Or do my eyes deceive me?""It has the look of a pub," Bill said."It looks to me like a pub," I said."I say," said Harris, "let's utilize it." He had taken up utilizing from Bill.We had a bottle of wine apiece. Harris would not let us pay. He talked Spanish quite well, and the innkeeper would not take our money."I say. You don't know what it's meant to me to have you chaps up here.""We've had a grand time, Harris."Harris was a little tight."I say. Really you don't know how much it means. I've not had much fun since the war.""We'll fish together again, some time. Don't you forget it, Harris.""We must. We have had such a jolly good time.""How about another bottle around?""Jolly good idea," said Harris."This is mine," said Bill. "Or we don't drink it.""I wish you'd let me pay for it. It does give me pleasure, you know.""This is going to give me pleasure," Bill said.The innkeeper brought in the fourth bottle. We had kept the same glasses. Harris lifted his glass."I say. You know this does utilize well."Bill slapped him on the back."Good old Harris.""I say. You know my name isn't really Harris. It's Wilson-Harris. All one name. With a hyphen, you know.""Good old Wilson-Harris," Bill said. "We call you Harris because we're so fond of you.""I say, Barnes. You don't know what this all means to me.""Come on and utilize another glass," I said."Barnes. Really, Barnes, you can't know. That's all.""Drink up, Harris."We walked back down the road from Roncesvalles with Harris between us. We had lunch at the inn and Harris went with us to the bus. He gave us his card, with his address in London and his club and his business address, and as we got on the bus he handed us each an envelope. I opened mine and there were a dozen flies in it. Harris had tied them himself. He tied all his own flies."I say, Harris--" I began."No, no!" he said. He was climbing down from the bus. "They're not first-rate flies at all. I only thought if you fished them some time it might remind you of what a good time we had."The bus started. Harris stood in front of the post-office. He waved. As we started along the road he turned and walked back toward the inn."Say, wasn't that Harris nice?" Bill said."I think he really did have a good time.""Harris? You bet he did.""I wish he'd come into Pamplona.""He wanted to fish.""Yes. You couldn't tell how English would mix with each other, anyway.""I suppose not."We got into Pamplona late in the afternoon and the bus stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya. Out in the plaza they were stringing electric-light wires to light the plaza for the fiesta. A few kids came up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with us, smiling in his embarrassed way."Your friends are here," he said."Mr. Campbell?""Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley."He smiled as though there were something I would hear about."When did they get in?""Yesterday. I've saved you the rooms you had.""That's fine. Did you give Mr. Campbell the room on the plaza?""Yes. All the rooms we looked at.""Where are our friends now?""I think they went to the pelota.""And how about the bulls?"Montoya smiled. "To-night," he said. "To-night at seven o'clock they bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go down?""Oh, yes. They've never seen a desencajonada."Montoya put his hand on my shoulder."I'll see you there."He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very deep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not understand."Your friend, is he aficionado, too?" Montoya smiled at Bill."Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.""Yes?" Montoya politely disbelieved. "But he's not aficionado like you."He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly."Yes," I said. "He's a real aficionado.""But he's not aficionado like you are."Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya's hotel; that is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed once, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year. In Montoya's room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated to Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters Montoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean anything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the waste-basket. He did not want them around.We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed putting the hand on the shoulder, or a "Buen hombre." But nearly always there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch you to make it certain.Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling open of the horses in bull-fighting.Bill had gone up-stairs as we came in, and I found him washing and changing in his room."Well," he said, "talk a lot of Spanish?""He was telling me about the bulls coming in to-night.""Let's find the gang and go down.""All right. They'll probably be at the café.""Have you got tickets?""Yes. I got them for all the unloadings.""What's it like?" He was pulling his cheek before the glass, looking to see if there were unshaved patches under the line of the jaw."It's pretty good," I said. "They let the bulls out of the cages one at a time, and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting, and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down.""Do they ever gore the steers?""Sure. Sometimes they go right after them and kill them.""Can't the steers do anything?""No. They're trying to make friends.""What do they have them in for?""To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the stone walls, or goring each other.""Must be swell being a steer."We went down the stairs and out of the door and walked across the square toward the Café Iruña. There were two lonely looking ticket-houses standing in the square. Their windows, marked SOL, SOL Y SOMBRA, and SOMBRA, were shut. They would not open until the day before the fiesta.Across the square the white wicker tables and chairs of the Iruña extended out beyond the Arcade to the edge of the street. I looked for Brett and Mike at the tables. There they were. Brett and Mike and Robert Cohn. Brett was wearing a Basque beret. So was Mike. Robert Cohn was bare-headed and wearing his spectacles. Brett saw us coming and waved. Her eyes crinkled up as we came up to the table."Hello, you chaps!" she called.Brett was happy. Mike had a way of getting an intensity of feeling into shaking hands. Robert Cohn shook hands because we were back."Where the hell have you been?" I asked."I brought them up here," Cohn said."What rot," Brett said. "We'd have gotten here earlier if you hadn't come.""You'd never have gotten here.""What rot! You chaps are brown. Look at Bill.""Did you get good fishing?" Mike asked. "We wanted to join you.""It wasn't bad. We missed you.""I wanted to come," Cohn said, "but I thought I ought to bring them.""You bring us. What rot.""Was it really good?" Mike asked. "Did you take many?""Some days we took a dozen apiece. There was an Englishman up there.""Named Harris," Bill said. "Ever know him, Mike? He was in the war, too.""Fortunate fellow," Mike said. "What times we had. How I wish those dear days were back.""Don't be an ass.""Were you in the war, Mike?" Cohn asked."Was I not.""He was a very distinguished soldier," Brett said. "Tell them about the time your horse bolted down Piccadilly.""I'll not. I've told that four times.""You never told me," Robert Cohn said."I'll not tell that story. It reflects discredit on me.""Tell them about your medals.""I'll not. That story reflects great discredit on me.""What story's that?""Brett will tell you. She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me.""Go on. Tell it, Brett.""Should I?""I'll tell it myself.""What medals have you got, Mike?""I haven't got any medals.""You must have some.""I suppose I've the usual medals. But I never sent in for them. One time there was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there, and the cards said medals will be worn. So naturally I had no medals, and I stopped at my tailor's and he was impressed by the invitation, and I thought that's a good piece of business, and I said to him: 'You've got to fix me up with some medals.' He said: 'What medals, sir?' And I said: 'Oh, any medals. Just give me a few medals.' So he said: 'What medals have you, sir?' And I said: 'How should I know?' Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette? 'Just give me a good lot. Pick them out yourself.' So he got me some medals, you know, miniature medals, and handed me the box, and I put it in my pocket and forgot it. Well, I went to the dinner, and it was the night they'd shot Henry Wilson, so the Prince didn't come and the King didn't come, and no one wore any medals, and all these coves were busy taking off their medals, and I had mine in my pocket."He stopped for us to laugh."Is that all?""That's all. Perhaps I didn't tell it right.""You didn't," said Brett. "But no matter."We were all laughing."Ah, yes," said Mike. "I know now. It was a damn dull dinner, and I couldn't stick it, so I left. Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket. What's this? I said. Medals? Bloody military medals? So I cut them all off their backing--you know, they put them on a strip--and gave them all around. Gave one to each girl. Form of souvenir. They thought I was hell's own shakes of a soldier. Give away medals in a night club. Dashing fellow.""Tell the rest," Brett said."Don't you think that was funny?" Mike asked. We were all laughing. "It was. I swear it was. Any rate, my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back. Sent a man around. Kept on writing for months. Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned. Frightfully military cove. Set hell's own store by them." Mike paused. "Rotten luck for the tailor," he said."You don't mean it," Bill said. "I should think it would have been grand for the tailor.""Frightfully good tailor. Never believe it to see me now," Mike said. "I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet. So he wouldn't send me any bills. Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt. It was right after the medals. Gave his letters rather a bitter tone.""How did you go bankrupt?" Bill asked."Two ways," Mike said. "Gradually and then suddenly.""What brought it on?""Friends," said Mike. "I had a lot of friends. False friends. Then I had creditors, too. Probably had more creditors than anybody in England.""Tell them about in the court," Brett said."I don't remember," Mike said. "I was just a little tight.""Tight!" Brett exclaimed. "You were blind!""Extraordinary thing," Mike said. "Met my former partner the other day. Offered to buy me a drink.""Tell them about your learned counsel," Brett said."I will not," Mike said. "My learned counsel was blind, too. I say this is a gloomy subject. Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not?""Let's go down."We called the waiter, paid, and started to walk through the town. I started off walking with Brett, but Robert Cohn came up and joined her on the other side. The three of us walked along, past the Ayuntamiento with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were many people walking to go and see the bulls, and carriages drove down the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips rising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we turned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in the window: Good Wine 30 Centimes A Liter."That's where we'll go when funds get low," Brett said.The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the window and stared. They were staring at Brett.At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that went in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low, stone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the face of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls that separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with the bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out of their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name and the brand of the bull-breeder.We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the corral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall."Look up there," I said.Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls and ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications made three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had climbed into the trees."They must think something is going to happen," Brett said."They want to see the bulls."Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They waved to us. People who had come late were standing behind us, pressing against us when other people crowded them."Why don't they start?" Robert Cohn asked.A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against the gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars into position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull would enter."They don't look happy," Brett said.The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark. Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to explode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his horns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the crowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall, their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.The bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick, searching drives with the right horn."My God, isn't he beautiful?" Brett said. We were looking right down on him."Look how he knows how to use his horns," I said. "He's got a left and a right just like a boxer.""Not really?""You watch.""It goes too fast.""Wait. There'll be another one in a minute."They had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull came out into the corral.He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the planks and shouted, to turn him. He did not change his direction and the men shouted: "Hah! Hah! Toro!" and waved their arms; the two steers turned sideways to take the shock, and the bull drove into one of the steers."Don't look," I said to Brett. She was watching, fascinated."Fine," I said. "If it doesn't buck you.""I saw it," she said. "I saw him shift from his left to his right horn.""Damn good!"The steer was down now, his neck stretched out, his head twisted, he lay the way he had fallen. Suddenly the bull left off and made for the other steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging, watching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The next time he nosed at the steer and then the two of them trotted over to the other bull.When the next bull came out, all three, the two bulls and the steer, stood together, their heads side by side, their horns against the newcomer. In a few minutes the steer picked the new bull up, quieted him down, and made him one of the herd. When the last two bulls had been unloaded the herd were all together.The steer who had been gored had gotten to his feet and stood against the stone wall. None of the bulls came near him, and he did not attempt to join the herd.We climbed down from the wall with the crowd, and had a last look at the bulls through the loopholes in the wall of the corral. They were all quiet now, their heads down. We got a carriage outside and rode up to the café. Mike and Bill came in half an hour later. They had stopped on the way for several drinks.We were sitting in the café."That's an extraordinary business," Brett said."Will those last ones fight as well as the first?" Robert Cohn asked. "They seemed to quiet down awfully fast.""They all know each other," I said. "They're only dangerous when they're alone, or only two or three of them together.""What do you mean, dangerous?" Bill said. "They all looked dangerous to me.""They only want to kill when they're alone. Of course, if you went in there you'd probably detach one of them from the herd, and he'd be dangerous.""That's too complicated," Bill said. "Don't you ever detach me from the herd, Mike.""I say," Mike said, "they were fine bulls, weren't they? Did you see their horns?""Did I not," said Brett. "I had no idea what they were like.""Did you see the one hit that steer?" Mike asked. "That was extraordinary.""It's no life being a steer," Robert Cohn said."Don't you think so?" Mike said. "I would have thought you'd loved being a steer, Robert.""What do you mean, Mike?""They lead such a quiet life. They never say anything and they're always hanging about so."We were embarrassed. Bill laughed. Robert Cohn was angry. Mike went on talking."I should think you'd love it. You'd never have to say a word. Come on, Robert. Do say something. Don't just sit there.""I said something, Mike. Don't you remember? About the steers.""Oh, say something more. Say something funny. Can't you see we're all having a good time here?""Come off it, Michael. You're drunk," Brett said."I'm not drunk. I'm quite serious. Is Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time?""Shut up, Michael. Try and show a little breeding.""Breeding be damned. Who has any breeding, anyway, except the bulls? Aren't the bulls lovely? Don't you like them, Bill? Why don't you say something, Robert? Don't sit there looking like a bloody funeral. What if Brett did sleep with you? She's slept with lots of better people than you.""Shut up," Cohn said. He stood up. "Shut up, Mike.""Oh, don't stand up and act as though you were going to hit me. That won't make any difference to me. Tell me, Robert. Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer? Don't you know you're not wanted? I know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you know when you're not wanted? You came down to San Sebastian where you weren't wanted, and followed Brett around like a bloody steer. Do you think that's right?""Shut up. You're drunk.""Perhaps I am drunk. Why aren't you drunk? Why don't you ever get drunk, Robert? You know you didn't have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties. You can't blame them hardly. Can you? I asked them to. They wouldn't do it. You can't blame them, now. Can you? Now, answer me. Can you blame them?""Go to hell, Mike.""I can't blame them. Can you blame them? Why do you follow Brett around? Haven't you any manners? How do you think it makes me feel?""You're a splendid one to talk about manners," Brett said. "You've such lovely manners.""Come on, Robert," Bill said."What do you follow her around for?"Bill stood up and took hold of Cohn."Don't go," Mike said. "Robert Cohn's going to buy a drink."Bill went off with Cohn. Cohn's face was sallow. Mike went on talking. I sat and listened for a while. Brett looked disgusted."I say, Michael, you might not be such a bloody ass," she interrupted. "I'm not saying he's not right, you know." She turned to me.The emotion left Mike's voice. We were all friends together."I'm not so damn drunk as I sounded," he said."I know you're not," Brett said."We're none of us sober," I said."I didn't say anything I didn't mean.""But you put it so badly," Brett laughed."He was an ass, though. He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well wasn't wanted. He hung around Brett and just looked at her. It made me damned well sick.""He did behave very badly," Brett said."Mark you. Brett's had affairs with men before. She tells me all about everything. She gave me this chap Cohn's letters to read. I wouldn't read them.""Damned noble of you.""No, listen, Jake. Brett's gone off with men. But they weren't ever Jews, and they didn't come and hang about afterward.""Damned good chaps," Brett said. "It's all rot to talk about it. Michael and I understand each other.""She gave me Robert Cohn's letters. I wouldn't read them.""You wouldn't read any letters, darling. You wouldn't read mine.""I can't read letters," Mike said. "Funny, isn't it?""You can't read anything.""No. You're wrong there. I read quite a bit. I read when I'm at home.""You'll be writing next," Brett said. "Come on, Michael. Do buck up. You've got to go through with this thing now. He's here. Don't spoil the fiesta.""Well, let him behave, then.""He'll behave. I'll tell him.""You tell him, Jake. Tell him either he must behave or get out.""Yes," I said, "it would be nice for me to tell him.""Look, Brett. Tell Jake what Robert calls you. That is perfect, you know.""Oh, no. I can't.""Go on. We're all friends. Aren't we all friends, Jake?""I can't tell him. It's too ridiculous.""I'll tell him.""You won't, Michael. Don't be an ass.""He calls her Circe," Mike said. "He claims she turns men into swine. Damn good. I wish I were one of these literary chaps.""He'd be good, you know," Brett said. "He writes a good letter.""I know," I said. "He wrote me from San Sebastian.""That was nothing," Brett said. "He can write a damned amusing letter.""She made me write that. She was supposed to be ill.""I damned well was, too.""Come on," I said, "we must go in and eat.""How should I meet Cohn?" Mike said."Just act as though nothing had happened.""It's quite all right with me," Mike said. "I'm not embarrassed.""If he says anything, just say you were tight.""Quite. And the funny thing is I think I was tight.""Come on," Brett said. "Are these poisonous things paid for? I must bathe before dinner."We walked across the square. It was dark and all around the square were the lights from the cafés under the arcades. We walked across the gravel under the trees to the hotel.They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak with Montoya."Well, how did you like the bulls?" he asked."Good. They were nice bulls.""They're all right"--Montoya shook his head--"but they're not too good.""What didn't you like about them?""I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good.""I know what you mean.""They're all right.""Yes. They're all right.""How did your friends like them?""Fine.""Good," Montoya said.I went up-stairs. Bill was in his room standing on the balcony looking out at the square. I stood beside him."Where's Cohn?""Up-stairs in his room.""How does he feel?""Like hell, naturally. Mike was awful. He's terrible when he's tight.""He wasn't so tight.""The hell he wasn't. I know what we had before we came to the café.""He sobered up afterward.""Good. He was terrible. I don't like Cohn, God knows, and I think it was a silly trick for him to go down to San Sebastian, but nobody has any business to talk like Mike.""How'd you like the bulls?""Grand. It's grand the way they bring them out.""To-morrow come the Miuras.""When does the fiesta start?""Day after to-morrow.""We've got to keep Mike from getting so tight. That kind of stuff is terrible.""We'd better get cleaned up for supper.""Yes. That will be a pleasant meal.""Won't it?"As a matter of fact, supper was a pleasant meal. Brett wore a black, sleeveless evening dress. She looked quite beautiful. Mike acted as though nothing had happened. I had to go up and bring Robert Cohn down. He was reserved and formal, and his face was still taut and sallow, but he cheered up finally. He could not stop looking at Brett. It seemed to make him happy. It must have been pleasant for him to see her looking so lovely, and know he had been away with her and that every one knew it. They could not take that away from him. Bill was very funny. So was Michael. They were good together.It was like certain dinners I remember from the war. There was much wine, an ignored tension, and a feeling of things coming that you could not prevent happening. Under the wine I lost the disgusted feeling and was happy. It seemed they were all such nice people.I do not know what time I got to bed. I remember undressing, putting on a bathrobe, and standing out on the balcony. I knew I was quite drunk, and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in "A Sportsman's Sketches." I had read it before, but it seemed quite new. The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that feeling would pass.I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night outside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the room next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is light. The hell there isn't!I figured that all out once, and for six months I never slept with the electric light off. That was another bright idea. To hell with women, anyway. To hell with you, Brett Ashley.Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it. I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the swell things you could count on.I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values. You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances, or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money's worth and knowing when you had it. You could get your money's worth. The world was a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years, I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies I've had.Perhaps that wasn't true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you learned from that what it was all about.I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never drunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What rot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The English spoken language--the upper classes, anyway--must have fewer words than the Eskimo. Of course I didn't know anything about the Eskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn't know anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though. I liked the way they talked. Take Harris. Still Harris was not the upper classes.I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was another good thing you paid for and then had. Some time along toward daylight I went to sleep.* * * * *The next two days in Pamplona were quiet, and there were no more rows. The town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their way to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each timber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being swept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced weakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old women sweeping out the boxes.Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees. The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth advertised ANIS DEL TORO. The cloth sign hung against the planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the terrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and the man with a hose who sprinkled the gravelled square and watered the streets.In the evening was the paseo. For an hour after dinner every one, all the good-looking girls, the officers from the garrison, all the fashionable people of the town, walked in the street on one side of the square while the café tables filled with the regular after-dinner crowd.During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times, once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know. We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went for a walk out to the gypsy camp, and Brett had her fortune told.It was a good morning, there were high white clouds above the mountains. It had rained a little in the night and it was fresh and cool on the plateau, and there was a wonderful view. We all felt good and we felt healthy, and I felt quite friendly to Cohn. You could not be upset about anything on a day like that.That was the last day before the fiesta.At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no other way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice them. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The peasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking, getting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting in values gradually. They could not start in paying café prices. They got their money's worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it would not matter what they paid, nor where they bought.Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been in the wine-shops of the narrow streets of the town since early morning. Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops. They were warming up. There were many people at the eleven o'clock mass. San Fermin is also a religious festival.I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café on the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were sitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and severe folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for action. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as soon as I sat down."What are you drinking?" I asked Bill and Robert."Sherry," Cohn said."Jerez," I said to the waiter.Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the fiesta went up in the square. It burst and there was a gray ball of smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the plaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright sunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of smoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get through the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the drums coming. They were playing the riau-riau music, the pipes shrill and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing. When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums tapped it out again, they all went up in the air dancing. In the crowd you saw only the heads and shoulders of the dancers going up and down.In the square a man, bent over, was playing on a reed-pipe, and a crowd of children were following him shouting, and pulling at his clothes. He came out of the square, the children following him, and piped them past the café and down a side street. We saw his blank pockmarked face as he went by, piping, the children close behind him shouting and pulling at him."He must be the village idiot," Bill said. "My God! look at that!"Down the street came dancers. The street was solid with dancers, all men. They were all dancing in time behind their own fifers and drummers. They were a club of some sort, and all wore workmen's blue smocks, and red handkerchiefs around their necks, and carried a great banner on two poles. The banner danced up and down with them as they came down surrounded by the crowd."Hurray for Wine! Hurray for the Foreigners!" was painted on the banner."Where are the foreigners?" Robert Cohn asked."We're the foreigners," Bill said.All the time rockets were going up. The café tables were all full now. The square was emptying of people and the crowd was filling the cafés."Where's Brett and Mike?" Bill asked."I'll go and get them," Cohn said."Bring them here."The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days. The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven days.That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the crowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced the riau-riau dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up and down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the riau-riau.They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the chapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers formed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths of white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms and put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the sharp riau-riau! they rushed us into a wine-shop.We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket."I want a leather wine-bottle," Bill said."There's a place down the street," I said. "I'll go get a couple."The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song. Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill's back.I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered, and I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both sides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was stencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on it"See! It doesn't leak.""I want another one, too. A big one."He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof. He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on the bota holding on to a chair."What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?""No. Drink out of them."He slapped me on the back."Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price."The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile stopped."It's true," he said. "Eight pesetas is cheap."I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop. It was darker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill, and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the wine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay then bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the back of his throat."All right," he said, and handed back the bag.In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by the dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else's shoulders, and they were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar with pieces of bread."Hello, Jake. Hello!" Mike called. "Come here. I want you to meet my friends. We're all having an hors-d'oeuvre."I was introduced to the people at the table. They supplied their names to Mike and sent for a fork for me."Stop eating their dinner, Michael," Brett shouted from the wine-barrels."I don't want to eat up your meal," I said when some one handed me a fork."Eat," he said. "What do you think it's here for?"I unscrewed the nozzle of the big wine-bottle and handed it around. Every one took a drink, tipping the wine-skin at arm's length.Outside, above the singing, we could hear the music of the procession going by."Isn't that the procession?" Mike asked."Nada," some one said. "It's nothing. Drink up. Lift the bottle.""Where did they find you?" I asked Mike."Some one brought me here," Mike said. "They said you were here.""Where's Cohn?""He's passed out," Brett called. "They've put him away somewhere.""Where is he?""I don't know.""How should we know," Bill said. "I think he's dead.""He's not dead," Mike said. "I know he's not dead. He's just passed out on Anis del Mono."As he said Anis del Mono one of the men at the table looked up, brought out a bottle from inside his smock, and handed it to me."No," I said. "No, thanks!""Yes. Yes. Arriba! Up with the bottle!"I took a drink. It tasted of licorice and warmed all the way. I could feel it warming in my stomach."Where the hell is Cohn?""I don't know," Mike said. "I'll ask. Where is the drunken comrade?" he asked in Spanish."You want to see him?""Yes," I said."Not me," said Mike. "This gent."The Anis del Mono man wiped his mouth and stood up."Come on."In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his chest was a big wreath of twisted garlics."Let him sleep," the man whispered. "He's all right."Two hours later Cohn appeared. He came into the front room still with the wreath of garlics around his neck. The Spaniards shouted when he came in. Cohn wiped his eyes and grinned."I must have been sleeping," he said."Oh, not at all," Brett said."You were only dead," Bill said."Aren't we going to go and have some supper?" Cohn asked."Do you want to eat?""Yes. Why not? I'm hungry.""Eat those garlics, Robert," Mike said. "I say. Do eat those garlics."Cohn stood there. His sleep had made him quite all right."Do let's go and eat," Brett said. "I must get a bath.""Come on," Bill said. "Let's translate Brett to the hotel."We said good-bye to many people and shook hands with many people and went out. Outside it was dark."What time is it do you suppose?" Cohn asked."It's to-morrow," Mike said. "You've been asleep two days.""No," said Cohn, "what time is it?""It's ten o'clock.""What a lot we've drunk.""You mean what a lot we've drunk. You went to sleep."Going down the dark streets to the hotel we saw the sky-rockets going up in the square. Down the side streets that led to the square we saw the square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After the dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six o'clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around four o'clock. The others stayed up.My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs and slept on one of the beds in Cohn's room. The fiesta was going on outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn's and went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right on and did not notice him. They were all running together.After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back in the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring. Back in bed, I went to sleep.Cohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and closed the window because the people on the balcony of the house just across the street were looking in."Did you see the show?" I asked."Yes. We were all there.""Anybody get hurt?""One of the bulls got into the crowd in the ring and tossed six or eight people.""How did Brett like it?""It was all so sudden there wasn't any time for it to bother anybody.""I wish I'd been up.""We didn't know where you were. We went to your room but it was locked.""Where did you stay up?""We danced at some club.""I got sleepy," I said."My gosh! I'm sleepy now," Cohn said. "Doesn't this thing ever stop?""Not for a week."Bill opened the door and put his head in."Where were you, Jake?""I saw them go through from the balcony. How was it?""Grand.""Where you going?""To sleep."No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade. The town was full of people. We had to wait for a table. After lunch we went over to the Iruña. It had filled up, and as the time for the bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The café did not make this same noise at any other time, no matter how crowded it was. This hum went on, and we were in it and a part of it.I had taken six seats for all the fights. Three of them were barreras, the first row at the ring-side, and three were sobrepuertos, seats with wooden backs, half-way up the amphitheatre. Mike thought Brett had best sit high up for her first time, and Cohn wanted to sit with them. Bill and I were going to sit in the barreras, and I gave the extra ticket to a waiter to sell. Bill said something to Cohn about what to do and how to look so he would not mind the horses. Bill had seen one season of bull-fights."I'm not worried about how I'll stand it. I'm only afraid I may be bored," Cohn said."You think so?""Don't look at the horses, after the bull hits them," I said to Brett. "Watch the charge and see the picador try and keep the bull off, but then don't look again until the horse is dead if it's been hit.""I'm a little nervy about it," Brett said. "I'm worried whether I'll be able to go through with it all right.""You'll be all right. There's nothing but that horse part that will bother you, and they're only in for a few minutes with each bull. Just don't watch when it's bad.""She'll be all right," Mike said. "I'll look after her.""I don't think you'll be bored," Bill said."I'm going over to the hotel to get the glasses and the wine-skin," I said. "See you back here. Don't get cock-eyed.""I'll come along," Bill said. Brett smiled at us.We walked around through the arcade to avoid the heat of the square."That Cohn gets me," Bill said. "He's got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will be being bored.""We'll watch him with the glasses," I said."Oh, to hell with him!""He spends a lot of time there.""I want him to stay there."In the hotel on the stairs we met Montoya."Come on," said Montoya. "Do you want to meet Pedro Romero?""Fine," said Bill. "Let's go see him."We followed Montoya up a flight and down the corridor."He's in room number eight," Montoya explained. "He's getting dressed for the bull-fight."Montoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were two beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on. The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes. His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing winding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up and stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking boy I have ever seen."You go to the bull-fight," he said in English."You know English," I said, feeling like an idiot."No," he answered, and smiled.One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us if we spoke French. "Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?"We thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We wished him "Mucha suerte," shook hands, and went out. He was standing, straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with the hangers-on as we shut the door."He's a fine boy, don't you think so?" Montoya asked."He's a good-looking kid," I said."He looks like a torero," Montoya said. "He has the type.""He's a fine boy.""We'll see how he is in the ring," Montoya said.We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my room, took it and the field-glasses, locked the door, and went down-stairs.It was a good bull-light. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was much.Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and Cohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front of them."Let me take the glasses," Bill said."Does Cohn look bored?" I asked."That kike!"Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in the crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta was going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the feet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and down. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café. The waiter saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched the crowd in the square and the dancers."What do you suppose that dance is?" Bill asked."It's a sort of jota.""They're not all the same," Bill said. "They dance differently to all the different tunes.""It's swell dancing."In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were dancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and concentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels touched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street."Here come the gentry," Bill said.They were crossing the street"Hello, men," I said."Hello, gents!" said Brett. "You saved us seats? How nice.""I say," Mike said, "that Romero what'shisname is somebody. Am I wrong?""Oh, isn't he lovely," Brett said. "And those green trousers.""Brett never took her eyes off them.""I say, I must borrow your glasses to-morrow.""How did it go?""Wonderfully! Simply perfect. I say, it is a spectacle!""How about the horses?""I couldn't help looking at them.""She couldn't take her eyes off them," Mike said. "She's an extraordinary wench.""They do have some rather awful things happen to them," Brett said. "I couldn't look away, though.""Did you feel all right?""I didn't feel badly at all.""Robert Cohn did," Mike put in. "You were quite green, Robert.""The first horse did bother me," Cohn said."You weren't bored, were you?" asked Bill.Cohn laughed."No. I wasn't bored. I wish you'd forgive me that.""It's all right," Bill said, "so long as you weren't bored.""He didn't look bored," Mike said. "I thought he was going to be sick.""I never felt that bad. It was just for a minute.""I thought he was going to be sick. You weren't bored, were you, Robert?""Let up on that, Mike. I said I was sorry I said it.""He was, you know. He was positively green.""Oh, shove it along, Michael.""You mustn't ever get bored at your first bull-fight, Robert," Mike said. "It might make such a mess.""Oh, shove it along, Michael," Brett said."He said Brett was a sadist," Mike said. "Brett's not a sadist. She's just a lovely, healthy wench.""Are you a sadist, Brett?" I asked."Hope not.""He said Brett was a sadist just because she has a good, healthy stomach.""Won't be healthy long."Bill got Mike started on something else than Cohn. The waiter brought the absinthe glasses."Did you really like it?" Bill asked Cohn."No, I can't say I liked it. I think it's a wonderful show.""Gad, yes! What a spectacle!" Brett said."I wish they didn't have the horse part," Cohn said."They're not important," Bill said. "After a while you never notice anything disgusting.""It is a bit strong just at the start," Brett said. "There's a dreadful moment for me just when the bull starts for the horse.""The bulls were fine," Cohn said."They were very good," Mike said."I want to sit down below, next time." Brett drank from her glass of absinthe."She wants to see the bull-fighters close by," Mike said."They are something," Brett said. "That Romero lad is just a child.""He's a damned good-looking boy," I said. "When we were up in his room I never saw a better-looking kid.""How old do you suppose he is?""Nineteen or twenty.""Just imagine it."The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first. Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull, and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked Romero's cape-work and why she did not like the others.Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and natural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero's bull-fighting gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he prepared him for the killing."I've never seen him do an awkward thing," Brett said."You won't until he gets frightened," I said."He'll never be frightened," Mike said. "He knows too damned much.""He knew everything when he started. The others can't ever learn what he was born with.""And God, what looks," Brett said."I believe, you know, that she's falling in love with this bull-fighter chap," Mike said."I wouldn't be surprised.""Be a good chap, Jake. Don't tell her anything more about him. Tell her how they beat their old mothers.""Tell me what drunks they are.""Oh, frightful," Mike said. "Drunk all day and spend all their time beating their poor old mothers.""He looks that way," Brett said."Doesn't he?" I said.They had hitched the mules to the dead bull and then the whips cracked, the men ran, and the mules, straining forward, their legs pushing, broke into a gallop, and the bull, one horn up, his head on its side, swept a swath smoothly across the sand and out the red gate."This next is the last one.""Not really," Brett said. She leaned forward on the barrera. Romero waved his picadors to their places, then stood, his cape against his chest, looking across the ring to where the bull would come out.After it was over we went out and were pressed tight in the crowd."These bull-fights are hell on one," Brett said. "I'm limp as a rag.""Oh, you'll get a drink," Mike said.The next day Pedro Romero did not fight. It was Miura bulls, and a very bad bull-fight. The next day there was no bull-fight scheduled. But all day and all night the fiesta kept on.In the morning it was raining. A fog had come over the mountains from the sea. You could not see the tops of the mountains. The plateau was dull and gloomy, and the shapes of the trees and the houses were changed. I walked out beyond the town to look at the weather. The bad weather was coming over the mountains from the sea.The flags in the square hung wet from the white poles and the banners were wet and hung damp against the front of the houses, and in between the steady drizzle the rain came down and drove every one under the arcades and made pools of water in the square, and the streets wet and dark and deserted; yet the fiesta kept up without any pause. It was only driven under cover.The covered seats of the bull-ring had been crowded with people sitting out of the rain watching the concourse of Basque and Navarrais dancers and singers, and afterward the Val Carlos dancers in their costumes danced down the street in the rain, the drums sounding hollow and damp, and the chiefs of the bands riding ahead on their big, heavy-footed horses, their costumes wet, the horses' coats wet in the rain. The crowd was in the cafés and the dancers came in, too, and sat, their tight-wound white legs under the tables, shaking the water from their belled caps, and spreading their red and purple jackets over the chairs to dry. It was raining hard outside.I left the crowd in the café and went over to the hotel to get shaved for dinner. I was shaving in my room when there was a knock on the door."Come in," I called.Montoya walked in."How are you?" he said."Fine," I said."No bulls to-day.""No," I said, "nothing but rain.""Where are your friends?""Over at the Iruña."Montoya smiled his embarrassed smile."Look," he said. "Do you know the American ambassador?""Yes," I said. "Everybody knows the American ambassador.""He's here in town, now.""Yes," I said. "Everybody's seen them.""I've seen them, too," Montoya said. He didn't say anything. I went on shaving."Sit down," I said. "Let me send for a drink.""No, I have to go."I finished shaving and put my face down into the bowl and washed it with cold water. Montoya was standing there looking more embarrassed."Look," he said. "I've just had a message from them at the Grand Hotel that they want Pedro Romero and Marcial Lalanda to come over for coffee to-night after dinner.""Well," I said, "it can't hurt Marcial any.""Marcial has been in San Sebastian all day. He drove over in a car this morning with Marquez. I don't think they'll be back to-night."Montoya stood embarrassed. He wanted me to say something."Don't give Romero the message," I said."You think so?""Absolutely."Montoya was very pleased."I wanted to ask you because you were an American," he said."That's what I'd do.""Look," said Montoya. "People take a boy like that. They don't know what he's worth. They don't know what he means. Any foreigner can flatter him. They start this Grand Hotel business, and in one year they're through.""Like Algabeno," I said."Yes, like Algabeno.""They're a fine lot," I said. "There's one American woman down here now that collects bull-fighters.""I know. They only want the young ones.""Yes," I said. "The old ones get fat.""Or crazy like Gallo.""Well," I said, "it's easy. All you have to do is not give him the message.""He's such a fine boy," said Montoya. "He ought to stay with his own people. He shouldn't mix in that stuff.""Won't you have a drink?" I asked."No," said Montoya, "I have to go." He went out.I went down-stairs and out the door and took a walk around through the arcades around the square. It was still raining. I looked in at the Iruña for the gang and they were not there, so I walked on around the square and back to the hotel. They were eating dinner in the down-stairs dining-room.They were well ahead of me and it was no use trying to catch them. Bill was buying shoe-shines for Mike. Bootblacks opened the street door and each one Bill called over and started to work on Mike."This is the eleventh time my boots have been polished," Mike said. "I say, Bill is an ass."The bootblacks had evidently spread the report. Another came in."Limpia botas?" he said to Bill."No," said Bill. "For this Señor."The bootblack knelt down beside the one at work and started on Mike's free shoe that shone already in the electric light."Bill's a yell of laughter," Mike said.I was drinking red wine, and so far behind them that I felt a little uncomfortable about all this shoe-shining. I looked around the room. At the next table was Pedro Romero. He stood up when I nodded, and asked me to come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost touching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man with a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I reached to our table for my wine-bottle, but the critic took my arm. Romero laughed."Drink here," he said in English.He was very bashful about his English, but he was really very pleased with it, and as we went on talking he brought out words he was not sure of, and asked me about them. He was anxious to know the English for Corrida de toros, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious of. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the lidia of a toro. The Spanish word corrida means in English the running of bulls--the French translation is Course de taureaux. The critic put that in. There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of Malagueño expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to explain after I had made the mistake."Where did you see me the other time? In Madrid?""Yes," I lied. I had read the accounts of his two appearances in Madrid in the bull-fight papers, so I was all right."The first or the second time?""The first.""I was very bad," he said. "The second time I was better. You remember?" He turned to the critic.He was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something altogether apart from himself. There was nothing conceited or braggartly about him."I like it very much that you like my work," he said. "But you haven't seen it yet. To-morrow, if I get a good bull, I will try and show it to you."When he said this he smiled, anxious that neither the bull-fight critic nor I would think he was boasting."I am anxious to see it," the critic said. "I would like to be convinced.""He doesn't like my work much." Romero turned to me. He was serious.The critic explained that he liked it very much, but that so far it had been incomplete."Wait till to-morrow, if a good one comes out.""Have you seen the bulls for to-morrow?" the critic asked me."Yes. I saw them unloaded."Pedro Romero leaned forward."What did you think of them?""Very nice," I said. "About twenty-six arrobas. Very short horns. Haven't you seen them?""Oh, yes," said Romero."They won't weigh twenty-six arrobas," said the critic."No," said Romero."They've got bananas for horns," the critic said."You call them bananas?" asked Romero. He turned to me and smiled. "You wouldn't call them bananas?""No," I said. "They're horns all right.""They're very short," said Pedro Romero. "Very, very short. Still, they aren't bananas.""I say, Jake," Brett called from the next table, "you have deserted us.""Just temporarily," I said. "We're talking bulls.""You are superior.""Tell him that bulls have no balls," Mike shouted. He was drunk.Romero looked at me inquiringly."Drunk," I said. "Borracho! Muy borracho!""You might introduce your friends," Brett said. She had not stopped looking at Pedro Romero. I asked them if they would like to have coffee with us. They both stood up. Romero's face was very brown. He had very nice manners.I introduced them all around and they started to sit down, but there was not enough room, so we all moved over to the big table by the wall to have coffee. Mike ordered a bottle of Fundador and glasses for everybody. There was a lot of drunken talking."Tell him I think writing is lousy," Bill said. "Go on, tell him. Tell him I'm ashamed of being a writer."Pedro Romero was sitting beside Brett and listening to her."Go on. Tell him!" Bill said.Romero looked up smiling."This gentleman," I said, "is a writer."Romero was impressed. "This other one, too," I said, pointing at Cohn."He looks like Villalta," Romero said, looking at Bill. "Rafael, doesn't he look like Villalta?""I can't see it," the critic said."Really," Romero said in Spanish. "He looks a lot like Villalta. What does the drunken one do?""Nothing.""Is that why he drinks?""No. He's waiting to marry this lady.""Tell him bulls have no balls!" Mike shouted, very drunk, from the other end of the table."What does he say?""He's drunk.""Jake," Mike called. "Tell him bulls have no balls!""You understand?" I said."Yes."I was sure he didn't, so it was all right."Tell him Brett wants to see him put on those green pants.""Pipe down, Mike.""Tell him Brett is dying to know how he can get into those pants.""Pipe down."During this Romero was fingering his glass and talking with Brett. Brett was talking French and he was talking Spanish and a little English, and laughing.Bill was filling the glasses."Tell him Brett wants to come into----""Oh, pipe down, Mike, for Christ's sake!"Romero looked up smiling. "Pipe down! I know that," he said.Just then Montoya came into the room. He started to smile at me, then he saw Pedro Romero with a big glass of cognac in his hand, sitting laughing between me and a woman with bare shoulders, at a table full of drunks. He did not even nod.Montoya went out of the room. Mike was on his feet proposing a toast. "Let's all drink to--" he began. "Pedro Romero," I said. Everybody stood up. Romero took it very seriously, and we touched glasses and drank it down, I rushing it a little because Mike was trying to make it clear that that was not at all what he was going to drink to. But it went off all right, and Pedro Romero shook hands with every one and he and the critic went out together."My God! he's a lovely boy," Brett said. "And how I would love to see him get into those clothes. He must use a shoe-horn.""I started to tell him," Mike began. "And Jake kept interrupting me. Why do you interrupt me? Do you think you talk Spanish better than I do?""Oh, shut up, Mike! Nobody interrupted you.""No, I'd like to get this settled." He turned away from me. "Do you think you amount to something, Cohn? Do you think you belong here among us? People who are out to have a good time? For God's sake don't be so noisy, Cohn!""Oh, cut it out, Mike," Cohn said."Do you think Brett wants you here? Do you think you add to the party? Why don't you say something?""I said all I had to say the other night, Mike.""I'm not one of you literary chaps." Mike stood shakily and leaned against the table. "I'm not clever. But I do know when I'm not wanted. Why don't you see when you're not wanted, Cohn? Go away. Go away, for God's sake. Take that sad Jewish face away. Don't you think I'm right?"He looked at us."Sure," I said. "Let's all go over to the Iruña.""No. Don't you think I'm right? I love that woman.""Oh, don't start that again. Do shove it along, Michael," Brett said."Don't you think I'm right, Jake?"Cohn still sat at the table. His face had the sallow, yellow look it got when he was insulted, but somehow he seemed to be enjoying it. The childish, drunken heroics of it. It was his affair with a lady of title."Jake," Mike said. He was almost crying. "You know I'm right. Listen, you!" He turned to Cohn: "Go away! Go away now!""But I won't go, Mike," said Cohn."Then I'll make you!" Mike started toward him around the table. Cohn stood up and took off his glasses. He stood waiting, his face sallow, his hands fairly low, proudly and firmly waiting for the assault, ready to do battle for his lady love.I grabbed Mike. "Come on to the café," I said. "You can't hit him here in the hotel.""Good!" said Mike. "Good idea!"We started off. I looked back as Mike stumbled up the stairs and saw Cohn putting his glasses on again. Bill was sitting at the table pouring another glass of Fundador. Brett was sitting looking straight ahead at nothing.Outside on the square it had stopped raining and the moon was trying to get through the clouds. There was a wind blowing. The military band was playing and the crowd was massed on the far side of the square where the fireworks specialist and his son were trying to send up fire balloons. A balloon would start up jerkily, on a great bias, and be torn by the wind or blown against the houses of the square. Some fell into the crowd. The magnesium flared and the fireworks exploded and chased about in the crowd. There was no one dancing in the square. The gravel was too wet.Brett came out with Bill and joined us. We stood in the crowd and watched Don Manuel Orquito, the fireworks king, standing on a little platform, carefully starting the balloons with sticks, standing above the heads of the crowd to launch the balloons off into the wind. The wind brought them all down, and Don Manuel Orquito's face was sweaty in the light of his complicated fireworks that fell into the crowd and charged and chased, sputtering and cracking, between the legs of the people. The people shouted as each new luminous paper bubble careened, caught fire, and fell."They're razzing Don Manuel," Bill said."How do you know he's Don Manuel?" Brett said."His name's on the programme. Don Manuel Orquito, the pirotecnico of esta ciudad.""Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A collection of globos illuminados. That's what the paper said."The wind blew the band music away."I say, I wish one would go up," Brett said. "That Don Manuel chap is furious.""He's probably worked for weeks fixing them to go off, spelling out 'Hail to San Fermin,'" Bill said."Globos illuminados," Mike said. "A bunch of bloody globos illuminados.""Come on," said Brett. "We can't stand here.""Her ladyship wants a drink," Mike said."How you know things," Brett said.Inside, the café was crowded and very noisy. No one noticed us come in. We could not find a table. There was a great noise going on."Come on, let's get out of here," Bill said.Outside the paseo was going in under the arcade. There were some English and Americans from Biarritz in sport clothes scattered at the tables. Some of the women stared at the people going by with lorgnons. We had acquired, at some time, a friend of Bill's from Biarritz. She was staying with another girl at the Grand Hotel. The other girl had a headache and had gone to bed."Here's the pub," Mike said. It was the Bar Milano, a small, tough bar where you could get food and where they danced in the back room. We all sat down at a table and ordered a bottle of Fundador. The bar was not full. There was nothing going on."This is a hell of a place," Bill said."It's too early.""Let's take the bottle and come back later," Bill said. "I don't want to sit here on a night like this.""Let's go and look at the English," Mike said. "I love to look at the English.""They're awful," Bill said. "Where did they all come from?""They come from Biarritz," Mike said, "They come to see the last day of the quaint little Spanish fiesta.""I'll festa them," Bill said."You're an extraordinarily beautiful girl." Mike turned to Bill's friend. "When did you come here?""Come off it, Michael.""I say, she is a lovely girl. Where have I been? Where have I been looking all this while? You're a lovely thing. Have we met? Come along with me and Bill. We're going to festa the English.""I'll festa them," Bill said, "What the hell are they doing at this fiesta?""Come on," Mike said. "Just us three. We're going to festa the bloody English. I hope you're not English? I'm Scotch. I hate the English. I'm going to festa them. Come on, Bill."Through the window we saw them, all three arm in arm, going toward the café. Rockets were going up in the square."I'm going to sit here," Brett said."I'll stay with you," Cohn said."Oh, don't!" Brett said. "For God's sake, go off somewhere. Can't you see Jake and I want to talk?""I didn't," Cohn said. "I thought I'd sit here because I felt a little tight.""What a hell of a reason for sitting with any one. If you're tight, go to bed. Go on to bed.""Was I rude enough to him?" Brett asked. Cohn was gone. "My God! I'm so sick of him!""He doesn't add much to the gayety.""He depresses me so.""He's behaved very badly.""Damned badly. He had a chance to behave so well.""He's probably waiting just outside the door now.""Yes. He would. You know I do know how he feels. He can't believe it didn't mean anything.""I know.""Nobody else would behave as badly. Oh, I'm so sick of the whole thing. And Michael. Michael's been lovely, too.""It's been damned hard on Mike.""Yes. But he didn't need to be a swine.""Everybody behaves badly," I said. "Give them the proper chance.""You wouldn't behave badly." Brett looked at me."I'd be as big an ass as Cohn," I said."Darling, don't let's talk a lot of rot.""All right. Talk about anything you like.""Don't be difficult. You're the only person I've got, and I feel rather awful to-night.""You've got Mike.""Yes, Mike. Hasn't he been pretty?""Well," I said, "it's been damned hard on Mike, having Cohn around and seeing him with you.""Don't I know it, darling? Please don't make me feel any worse than I do."Brett was nervous as I had never seen her before. She kept looking away from me and looking ahead at the wall."Want to go for a walk?""Yes. Come on."I corked up the Fundador bottle and gave it to the bartender."Let's have one more drink of that," Brett said. "My nerves are rotten."We each drank a glass of the smooth amontillado brandy."Come on," said Brett.As we came out the door I saw Cohn walk out from under the arcade."He was there," Brett said."He can't be away from you.""Poor devil!""I'm not sorry for him. I hate him, myself.""I hate him, too," she shivered. "I hate his damned suffering."We walked arm in arm down the side street away from the crowd and the lights of the square. The street was dark and wet, and we walked along it to the fortifications at the edge of town. We passed wine-shops with light coming out from their doors onto the black, wet street, and sudden bursts of music."Want to go in?""No."We walked out across the wet grass and onto the stone wall of the fortifications. I spread a newspaper on the stone and Brett sat down. Across the plain it was dark, and we could see the mountains. The wind was high up and took the clouds across the moon. Below us were the dark pits of the fortifications. Behind were the trees and the shadow of the cathedral, and the town silhouetted against the moon."Don't feel bad," I said."I feel like hell," Brett said. "Don't let's talk."We looked out at the plain. The long lines of trees were dark in the moonlight. There were the lights of a car on the road climbing the mountain. Up on the top of the mountain we saw the lights of the fort. Below to the left was the river. It was high from the rain, and black and smooth. Trees were dark along the banks. We sat and looked out. Brett stared straight ahead. Suddenly she shivered."It's cold.""Want to walk back?""Through the park."We climbed down. It was clouding over again. In the park it was dark under the trees."Do you still love me, Jake?""Yes," I said."Because I'm a goner," Brett said."How?""I'm a goner. I'm mad about the Romero boy. I'm in love with him, I think.""I wouldn't be if I were you.""I can't help it. I'm a goner. It's tearing me all up inside.""Don't do it.""I can't help it. I've never been able to help anything.""You ought to stop it.""How can I stop it? I can't stop things. Feel that?"Her hand was trembling."I'm like that all through.""You oughtn't to do it.""I can't help it. I'm a goner now, anyway. Don't you see the difference?""No.""I've got to do something. I've got to do something I really want to do. I've lost my self-respect.""You don't have to do that.""Oh, darling, don't be difficult. What do you think it's meant to have that damned Jew about, and Mike the way he's acted?""Sure.""I can't just stay tight all the time.""No.""Oh, darling, please stay by me. Please stay by me and see me through this.""Sure.""I don't say it's right. It is right though for me. God knows, I've never felt such a bitch.""What do you want me to do?""Come on," Brett said. "Let's go and find him."Together we walked down the gravel path in the park in the dark, under the trees and then out from under the trees and past the gate into the street that led into town.Pedro Romero was in the café. He was at a table with other bull-fighters and bull-fight critics. They were smoking cigars. When we came in they looked up. Romero smiled and bowed. We sat down at a table half-way down the room."Ask him to come over and have a drink.""Not yet. He'll come over.""I can't look at him.""He's nice to look at," I said."I've always done just what I wanted.""I know.""I do feel such a bitch.""Well," I said."My God!" said Brett, "the things a woman goes through.""Yes?""Oh, I do feel such a bitch."I looked across at the table. Pedro Romero smiled. He said something to the other people at his table, and stood up. He came over to our table. I stood up and we shook hands."Won't you have a drink?""You must have a drink with me," he said. He seated himself, asking Brett's permission without saying anything. He had very nice manners. But he kept on smoking his cigar. It went well with his face."You like cigars?" I asked."Oh, yes. I always smoke cigars."It was part of his system of authority. It made him seem older. I noticed his skin. It was clear and smooth and very brown. There was a triangular scar on his cheek-bone. I saw he was watching Brett. He felt there was something between them. He must have felt it when Brett gave him her hand. He was being very careful. I think he was sure, but he did not want to make any mistake."You fight to-morrow?" I said."Yes," he said. "Algabeno was hurt to-day in Madrid. Did you hear?""No," I said. "Badly?"He shook his head."Nothing. Here," he showed his hand. Brett reached out and spread the fingers apart."Oh!" he said in English, "you tell fortunes?""Sometimes. Do you mind?""No. I like it." He spread his hand flat on the table. "Tell me I live for always, and be a millionaire."He was still very polite, but he was surer of himself. "Look," he said, "do you see any bulls in my hand?"He laughed. His hand was very fine and the wrist was small."There are thousands of bulls," Brett said. She was not at all nervous now. She looked lovely."Good," Romero laughed. "At a thousand duros apiece," he said to me in Spanish. "Tell me some more.""It's a good hand," Brett said. "I think he'll live a long time.""Say it to me. Not to your friend.""I said you'd live a long time.""I know it," Romero said. "I'm never going to die."I tapped with my finger-tips on the table. Romero saw it. He shook his head."No. Don't do that. The bulls are my best friends."I translated to Brett."You kill your friends?" she asked."Always," he said in English, and laughed. "So they don't kill me." He looked at her across the table."You know English well.""Yes," he said. "Pretty well, sometimes. But I must not let anybody know. It would be very bad, a torero who speaks English.""Why?" asked Brett."It would be bad. The people would not like it. Not yet.""Why not?""They would not like it. Bull-fighters are not like that.""What are bull-fighters like?"He laughed and tipped his hat down over his eyes and changed the angle of his cigar and the expression of his face."Like at the table," he said. I glanced over. He had mimicked exactly the expression of Nacional. He smiled, his face natural again. "No. I must forget English.""Don't forget it, yet," Brett said."No?""No.""All right."He laughed again."I would like a hat like that," Brett said."Good. I'll get you one.""Right. See that you do.""I will. I'll get you one to-night."I stood up. Romero rose, too."Sit down," I said. "I must go and find our friends and bring them here."He looked at me. It was a final look to ask if it were understood. It was understood all right."Sit down," Brett said to him. "You must teach me Spanish."He sat down and looked at her across the table. I went out. The hard-eyed people at the bull-fighter table watched me go. It was not pleasant. When I came back and looked in the café, twenty minutes later, Brett and Pedro Romero were gone. The coffee-glasses and our three empty cognac-glasses were on the table. A waiter came with a cloth and picked up the glasses and mopped off the table.Outside the Bar Milano I found Bill and Mike and Edna. Edna was the girl's name."We've been thrown out," Edna said."By the police," said Mike. "There's some people in there that don't like me.""I've kept them out of four fights," Edna said. "You've got to help me."Bill's face was red."Come back in, Edna," he said. "Go on in there and dance with Mike.""It's silly," Edna said. "There'll just be another row.""Damned Biarritz swine," Bill said."Come on," Mike said. "After all, it's a pub. They can't occupy a whole pub.""Good old Mike," Bill said. "Damned English swine come here and insult Mike and try and spoil the fiesta.""They're so bloody," Mike said. "I hate the English.""They can't insult Mike," Bill said. "Mike is a swell fellow. They can't insult Mike. I won't stand it. Who cares if he is a damn bankrupt?" His voice broke."Who cares?" Mike said. "I don't care. Jake doesn't care. Do you care?""No," Edna said. "Are you a bankrupt?""Of course I am. You don't care, do you, Bill?"Bill put his arm around Mike's shoulder."I wish to hell I was a bankrupt. I'd show those bastards.""They're just English," Mike said. "It never makes any difference what the English say.""The dirty swine," Bill said. "I'm going to clean them out.""Bill," Edna looked at me. "Please don't go in again, Bill. They're so stupid.""That's it," said Mike. "They're stupid. I knew that was what it was.""They can't say things like that about Mike," Bill said."Do you know them?" I asked Mike."No. I never saw them. They say they know me.""I won't stand it," Bill said."Come on. Let's go over to the Suizo," I said."They're a bunch of Edna's friends from Biarritz," Bill said."They're simply stupid," Edna said."One of them's Charley Blackman, from Chicago," Bill said."I was never in Chicago," Mike said.Edna started to laugh and could not stop."Take me away from here," she said, "you bankrupts.""What kind of a row was it?" I asked Edna. We were walking across the square to the Suizo. Bill was gone."I don't know what happened, but some one had the police called to keep Mike out of the back room. There were some people that had known Mike at Cannes. What's the matter with Mike?""Probably he owes them money" I said. "That's what people usually get bitter about."In front of the ticket-booths out in the square there were two lines of people waiting. They were sitting on chairs or crouched on the ground with blankets and newspapers around them. They were waiting for the wickets to open in the morning to buy tickets for the bull-fight. The night was clearing and the moon was out. Some of the people in the line were sleeping.At the Café Suizo we had just sat down and ordered Fundador when Robert Cohn came up."Where's Brett?" he asked."I don't know.""She was with you.""She must have gone to bed.""She's not.""I don't know where she is."His face was sallow under the light. He was standing up."Tell me where she is.""Sit down," I said. "I don't know where she is.""The hell you don't!""You can shut your face.""Tell me where Brett is.""I'll not tell you a damn thing.""You know where she is.""If I did I wouldn't tell you.""Oh, go to hell, Cohn," Mike called from the table. "Brett's gone off with the bull-fighter chap. They're on their honeymoon.""You shut up.""Oh, go to hell!" Mike said languidly."Is that where she is?" Cohn turned to me."Go to hell!""She was with you. Is that where she is?""Go to hell!""I'll make you tell me"--he stepped forward--"you damned pimp."I swung at him and he ducked. I saw his face duck sideways in the light. He hit me and I sat down on the pavement. As I started to get on my feet he hit me twice. I went down backward under a table. I tried to get up and felt I did not have any legs. I felt I must get on my feet and try and hit him. Mike helped me up. Some one poured a carafe of water on my head. Mike had an arm around me, and I found I was sitting on a chair. Mike was pulling at my ears."I say, you were cold," Mike said."Where the hell were you?""Oh, I was around.""You didn't want to mix in it?""He knocked Mike down, too," Edna said."He didn't knock me out," Mike said. "I just lay there.""Does this happen every night at your fiestas?" Edna asked. "Wasn't that Mr. Cohn?""I'm all right," I said. "My head's a little wobbly."There were several waiters and a crowd of people standing around."Vaya!" said Mike. "Get away. Go on."The waiters moved the people away."It was quite a thing to watch," Edna said. "He must be a boxer.""He is.""I wish Bill had been here," Edna said. "I'd like to have seen Bill knocked down, too. I've always wanted to see Bill knocked down. He's so big.""I was hoping he would knock down a waiter," Mike said, "and get arrested. I'd like to see Mr. Robert Cohn in jail.""No," I said."Oh, no," said Edna. "You don't mean that.""I do, though," Mike said. "I'm not one of these chaps likes being knocked about. I never play games, even."Mike took a drink."I never liked to hunt, you know. There was always the danger of having a horse fall on you. How do you feel, Jake?""All right.""You're nice," Edna said to Mike. "Are you really a bankrupt?""I'm a tremendous bankrupt," Mike said. "I owe money to everybody. Don't you owe any money?""Tons.""I owe everybody money," Mike said. "I borrowed a hundred pesetas from Montoya to-night.""The hell you did," I said."I'll pay it back," Mike said. "I always pay everything back.""That's why you're a bankrupt, isn't it?" Edna said.I stood up. I had heard them talking from a long way away. It all seemed like some bad play."I'm going over to the hotel," I said. Then I heard them talking about me."Is he all right?" Edna asked."We'd better walk with him.""I'm all right," I said. "Don't come. I'll see you all later."I walked away from the café. They were sitting at the table. I looked back at them and at the empty tables. There was a waiter sitting at one of the tables with his head in his hands.Walking across the square to the hotel everything looked new and changed. I had never seen the trees before. I had never seen the flagpoles before, nor the front of the theatre. It was all different. I felt as I felt once coming home from an out-of-town football game. I was carrying a suitcase with my football things in it, and I walked up the street from the station in the town I had lived in all my life and it was all new. They were raking the lawns and burning leaves in the road, and I stopped for a long time and watched. It was all strange. Then I went on, and my feet seemed to be a long way off, and everything seemed to come from a long way off, and I could hear my feet walking a great distance away. I had been kicked in the head early in the game. It was like that crossing the square. It was like that going up the stairs in the hotel. Going up the stairs took a long time, and I had the feeling that I was carrying my suitcase. There was a light in the room. Bill came out and met me in the hall."Say," he said, "go up and see Cohn. He's been in a jam, and he's asking for you.""The hell with him.""Go on. Go on up and see him."I did not want to climb another flight of stairs."What are you looking at me that way for?""I'm not looking at you. Go on up and see Cohn. He's in bad shape.""You were drunk a little while ago," I said."I'm drunk now," Bill said. "But you go up and see Cohn. He wants to see you.""All right," I said. It was just a matter of climbing more stairs. I went on up the stairs carrying my phantom suitcase. I walked down the hall to Cohn's room. The door was shut and I knocked."Who is it?""Barnes.""Come in, Jake."I opened the door and went in, and set down my suitcase. There was no light in the room. Cohn was lying, face down, on the bed in the dark."Hello, Jake.""Don't call me Jake."I stood by the door. It was just like this that I had come home. Now it was a hot bath that I needed. A deep, hot bath, to lie back in."Where's the bathroom?" I asked.Cohn was crying. There he was, face down on the bed, crying. He had on a white polo shirt, the kind he'd worn at Princeton."I'm sorry, Jake. Please forgive me.""Forgive you, hell.""Please forgive me, Jake."I did not say anything. I stood there by the door."I was crazy. You must see how it was.""Oh, that's all right.""I couldn't stand it about Brett.""You called me a pimp."I did not care. I wanted a hot bath. I wanted a hot bath in deep water."I know. Please don't remember it. I was crazy.""That's all right."He was crying. His voice was funny. He lay there in his white shirt on the bed in the dark. His polo shirt."I'm going away in the morning."He was crying without making any noise."I just couldn't stand it about Brett. I've been through hell, Jake. It's been simply hell. When I met her down here Brett treated me as though I were a perfect stranger. I just couldn't stand it. We lived together at San Sebastian. I suppose you know it. I can't stand it any more."He lay there on the bed."Well," I said, "I'm going to take a bath.""You were the only friend I had, and I loved Brett so.""Well," I said, "so long.""I guess it isn't any use," he said. "I guess it isn't any damn use.""What?""Everything. Please say you forgive me, Jake.""Sure," I said. "It's all right.""I felt so terribly. I've been through such hell, Jake. Now everything's gone. Everything.""Well," I said, "so long. I've got to go."He rolled over, sat on the edge of the bed, and then stood up."So long, Jake," he said. "You'll shake hands, won't you?""Sure. Why not?"We shook hands. In the dark I could not see his face very well."Well," I said, "see you in the morning.""I'm going away in the morning.""Oh, yes," I said.I went out. Cohn was standing in the door of the room."Are you all right, Jake?" he asked."Oh, yes," I said. "I'm all right."I could not find the bathroom. After a while I found it. There was a deep stone tub. I turned on the taps and the water would not run. I sat down on the edge of the bath-tub. When I got up to go I found I had taken off my shoes. I hunted for them and found them and carried them down-stairs. I found my room and went inside and undressed and got into bed.* * * * *I woke with a headache and the noise of the bands going by in the street. I remembered I had promised to take Bill's friend Edna to see the bulls go through the street and into the ring. I dressed and went down-stairs and out into the cold early morning. People were crossing the square, hurrying toward the bull-ring. Across the square were the two lines of men in front of the ticket-booths. They were still waiting for the tickets to go on sale at seven o'clock. I hurried across the street to the café. The waiter told me that my friends had been there and gone."How many were they?""Two gentlemen and a lady."That was all right. Bill and Mike were with Edna. She had been afraid last night they would pass out. That was why I was to be sure to take her. I drank the coffee and hurried with the other people toward the bull-ring. I was not groggy now. There was only a bad headache. Everything looked sharp and clear, and the town smelt of the early morning.The stretch of ground from the edge of the town to the bull-ring was muddy. There was a crowd all along the fence that led to the ring, and the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with people. I heard the rocket and I knew I could not get into the ring in time to see the bulls come in, so I shoved through the crowd to the fence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They walked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come running. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed him over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long running pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He wanted to do capework with the bulls. The two policemen tore out, collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the fence and stood flattened out against the fence as the last of the crowd and the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy, muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running crowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man's arms were by his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted him and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front, but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were pressing through to the inside, there was a shout, then another shout.The man who had been gored lay face down in the trampled mud. People climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd was so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was happening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the bulls out of the ring and into the corrals. I left the fence and started back toward the town.Back in the town I went to the café to have a second coffee and some buttered toast. The waiters were sweeping out the café and mopping off the tables. One came over and took my order."Anything happen at the encierro?""I didn't see it all. One man was badly cogido.""Where?""Here." I put one hand on the small of my back and the other on my chest, where it looked as though the horn must have come through. The waiter nodded his head and swept the crumbs from the table with his cloth."Badly cogido," he said. "All for sport. All for pleasure."He went away and came back with the long-handled coffee and milk pots. He poured the milk and coffee. It came out of the long spouts in two streams into the big cup. The waiter nodded his head."Badly cogido through the back," he said. He put the pots down on the table and sat down in the chair at the table. "A big horn wound. All for fun. Just for fun. What do you think of that?""I don't know.""That's it. All for fun. Fun, you understand.""You're not an aficionado?""Me? What are bulls? Animals. Brute animals." He stood up and put his hand on the small of his back. "Right through the back. A cornada right through the back. For fun--you understand."He shook his head and walked away, carrying the coffee-pots. Two men were going by in the street. The waiter shouted to them. They were grave-looking. One shook his head. "Muerto!" he called.The waiter nodded his head. The two men went on. They were on some errand. The waiter came over to my table."You hear? Muerto. Dead. He's dead. With a horn through him. All for morning fun. Es muy flamenco.""It's bad.""Not for me," the waiter said. "No fun in that for me."Later in the day we learned that the man who was killed was named Vicente Girones, and came from near Tafalla. The next day in the paper we read that he was twenty-eight years old, and had a farm, a wife, and two children. He had continued to come to the fiesta each year after he was married. The next day his wife came in from Tafalla to be with the body, and the day after there was a service in the chapel of San Fermin, and the coffin was carried to the railway-station by members of the dancing and drinking society of Tafalla. The drums marched ahead, and there was music on the fifes, and behind the men who carried the coffin walked the wife and two children.... Behind them marched all the members of the dancing and drinking societies of Pamplona, Estella, Tafalla, and Sanguesa who could stay over for the funeral. The coffin was loaded into the baggage-car of the train, and the widow and the two children rode, sitting, all three together, in an open third-class railway-carriage. The train started with a jerk, and then ran smoothly, going down grade around the edge of the plateau and out into the fields of grain that blew in the wind on the plain on the way to Tafalla.The bull who killed Vicente Girones was named Bocanegra, was Number 118 of the bull-breeding establishment of Sanchez Tabemo, and was killed by Pedro Romero as the third bull of that same afternoon. His ear was cut by popular acclamation and given to Pedro Romero, who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along with a number of Muratti cigarette-stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the bed-table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya, in Pamplona.* * * * *Back in the hotel, the night watchman was sitting on a bench inside the door. He had been there all night and was very sleepy. He stood up as I came in. Three of the waitresses came in at the same time. They had been to the morning show at the bull-ring. They went up-stairs laughing. I followed them up-stairs and went into my room. I took off my shoes and lay down on the bed. The window was open onto the balcony and the sunlight was bright in the room. I did not feel sleepy. It must have been half past three o'clock when I had gone to bed and the bands had waked me at six. My jaw was sore on both sides. I felt it with my thumb and fingers. That damn Cohn. He should have hit somebody the first time he was insulted, and then gone away. He was so sure that Brett loved him. He was going to stay, and true love would conquer all. Some one knocked on the door."Come in."It was Bill and Mike. They sat down on the bed."Some encierro," Bill said. "Some encierro.""I say, weren't you there?" Mike asked. "Ring for some beer, Bill.""What a morning!" Bill said. He mopped off his face. "My God! what a morning! And here's old Jake. Old Jake, the human punching-bag.""What happened inside?""Good God!" Bill said, "what happened, Mike?""There were these bulls coming in," Mike said. "Just ahead of them was the crowd, and some chap tripped and brought the whole lot of them down.""And the bulls all came in right over them," Bill said."I heard them yell.""That was Edna," Bill said."Chaps kept coming out and waving their shirts.""One bull went along the barrera and hooked everybody over.""They took about twenty chaps to the infirmary," Mike said."What a morning!" Bill said. "The damn police kept arresting chaps that wanted to go and commit suicide with the bulls.""The steers took them in, in the end," Mike said."It took about an hour.""It was really about a quarter of an hour," Mike objected."Oh, go to hell," Bill said. "You've been in the war. It was two hours and a half for me.""Where's that beer?" Mike asked."What did you do with the lovely Edna?""We took her home just now. She's gone to bed.""How did she like it?""Fine. We told her it was just like that every morning.""She was impressed," Mike said."She wanted us to go down in the ring, too," Bill said. "She likes action.""I said it wouldn't be fair to my creditors," Mike said."What a morning," Bill said. "And what a night!""How's your jaw, Jake?" Mike asked."Sore," I said.Bill laughed."Why didn't you hit him with a chair?""You can talk," Mike said. "He'd have knocked you out, too. I never saw him hit me. I rather think I saw him just before, and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street, and Jake was lying under a table.""Where did he go afterward?" I asked."Here she is," Mike said. "Here's the beautiful lady with the beer."The chambermaid put the tray with the beer-bottles and glasses down on the table."Now bring up three more bottles," Mike said."Where did Cohn go after he hit me?" I asked Bill."Don't you know about that?" Mike was opening a beer-bottle. He poured the beer into one of the glasses, holding the glass close to the bottle."Really?" Bill asked."Why he went in and found Brett and the bull-fighter chap in the bull-fighter's room, and then he massacred the poor, bloody bull-fighter.""No.""Yes.""What a night!" Bill said."He nearly killed the poor, bloody bull-fighter. Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away. Wanted to make an honest woman of her, I imagine. Damned touching scene."He took a long drink of the beer."He is an ass.""What happened?""Brett gave him what for. She told him off. I think she was rather good.""I'll bet she was," Bill said."Then Cohn broke down and cried, and wanted to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. He wanted to shake hands with Brett, too.""I know. He shook hands with me.""Did he? Well, they weren't having any of it. The bull-fighter fellow was rather good. He didn't say much, but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again. Cohn couldn't knock him out. It must have been damned funny.""Where did you hear all this?""Brett. I saw her this morning.""What happened finally?""It seems the bull-fighter fellow was sitting on the bed. He'd been knocked down about fifteen times, and he wanted to fight some more. Brett held him and wouldn't let him get up. He was weak, but Brett couldn't hold him, and he got up. Then Cohn said he wouldn't hit him again. Said he couldn't do it. Said it would be wicked. So the bull-fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him. Cohn went back against the wall."'So you won't hit me?'"'No,' said Cohn. 'I'd be ashamed to.'"So the bull-fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face, and then sat down on the floor. He couldn't get up, Brett said. Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed. He said if Cohn helped him he'd kill him, and he'd kill him anyway this morning if Cohn wasn't out of town. Cohn was crying, and Brett had told him off, and he wanted to shake hands. I've told you that before.""Tell the rest," Bill said."It seems the bull-fighter chap was sitting on the floor. He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again. Brett wasn't having any shaking hands, and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her, and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass. Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull-fighter fellow. No hard feelings, you know. All for forgiveness. And the bull-fighter chap hit him in the face again.""That's quite a kid," Bill said."He ruined Cohn," Mike said. "You know I don't think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again.""When did you see Brett?""This morning. She came in to get some things. She's looking after this Romero lad."He poured out another bottle of beer."Brett's rather cut up. But she loves looking after people. That's how we came to go off together. She was looking after me.""I know," I said."I'm rather drunk," Mike said. "I think I'll stay rather drunk. This is all awfully amusing, but it's not too pleasant. It's not too pleasant for me."He drank off the beer."I gave Brett what for, you know. I said if she would go about with Jews and bull-fighters and such people, she must expect trouble." He leaned forward. "I say, Jake, do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours? She'll bring you another one.""Please," I said. "I wasn't drinking it, anyway."Mike started to open the bottle. "Would you mind opening it?" I pressed up the wire fastener and poured it for him."You know," Mike went on, "Brett was rather good. She's always rather good. I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull-fighters, and all those sort of people, and do you know what she said: 'Yes. I've had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy!'"He took a drink."That was rather good. Ashley, chap she got the title from, was a sailor, you know. Ninth baronet. When he came home he wouldn't sleep in a bed. Always made Brett sleep on the floor. Finally, when he got really bad, he used to tell her he'd kill her. Always slept with a loaded service revolver. Brett used to take the shells out when he'd gone to sleep. She hasn't had an absolutely happy life. Brett. Damned shame, too. She enjoys things so."He stood up. His hand was shaky."I'm going in the room. Try and get a little sleep."He smiled."We go too long without sleep in these fiestas. I'm going to start now and get plenty of sleep. Damn bad thing not to get sleep. Makes you frightfully nervy.""We'll see you at noon at the Iruña," Bill said.Mike went out the door. We heard him in the next room.He rang the bell and the chambermaid came and knocked at the door."Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador," Mike told her."Si, Señorito.""I'm going to bed," Bill said. "Poor old Mike. I had a hell of a row about him last night.""Where? At that Milano place?""Yes. There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes, once. He was damned nasty.""I know the story.""I didn't. Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike.""That's what makes it bad.""They oughtn't to have any right. I wish to hell they didn't have any right. I'm going to bed.""Was anybody killed in the ring?""I don't think so. Just badly hurt.""A man was killed outside in the runway.""Was there?" said Bill.At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it. They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the fiesta.The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were going. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on each other's shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing."Here comes Brett," Bill said.I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking, her head up, as though the fiesta were being staged in her honor, and she found it pleasant and amusing."Hello, you chaps!" she said. "I say, I have a thirst.""Get another big beer," Bill said to the waiter."Shrimps?""Is Cohn gone?" Brett asked."Yes," Bill said. "He hired a car."The beer came. Brett started to lift the glass mug and her hand shook. She saw it and smiled, and leaned forward and took a long sip."Good beer.""Very good," I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had slept. He must have been drinking all the time, but he seemed to be under control."I heard Cohn had hurt you, Jake," Brett said."No. Knocked me out. That was all.""I say, he did hurt Pedro Romero," Brett said. "He hurt him most badly.""How is he?""He'll be all right. He won't go out of the room.""Does he look badly?""Very. He was really hurt. I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute.""Is he going to fight?""Rather. I'm going with you, if you don't mind.""How's your boy friend?" Mike asked. He had not listened to anything that Brett had said."Brett's got a bull-fighter," he said. "She had a Jew named Cohn, but he turned out badly."Brett stood up."I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you, Michael.""How's your boy friend?""Damned well," Brett said. "Watch him this afternoon.""Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "A beautiful, bloody bull-fighter.""Would you mind walking over with me? I want to talk to you, Jake.""Tell him all about your bull-fighter," Mike said. "Oh, to hell with your bull-fighter!" He tipped the table so that all the beers and the dish of shrimps went over in a crash."Come on," Brett said. "Let's get out of this."In the crowd crossing the square I said: "How is it?""I'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight. His people come in and dress him. They're very angry about me, he says."Brett was radiant. She was happy. The sun was out and the day was bright."I feel altogether changed," Brett said. "You've no idea, Jake.""Anything you want me to do?""No, just go to the fight with me.""We'll see you at lunch?""No. I'm eating with him."We were standing under the arcade at the door of the hotel. They were carrying tables out and setting them up under the arcade."Want to take a turn out to the park?" Brett asked. "I don't want to go up yet. I fancy he's sleeping."We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of booths. We came out on a cross-street that led to the Paseo de Sarasate. We could see the crowd walking there, all the fashionably dressed people. They were making the turn at the upper end of the park."Don't let's go there," Brett said. "I don't want staring at just now."We stood in the sunlight. It was hot and good after the rain and the clouds from the sea."I hope the wind goes down," Brett said. "It's very bad for him.""So do I.""He says the bulls are all right.""They're good.""Is that San Fermin's?"Brett looked at the yellow wall of the chapel."Yes. Where the show started on Sunday.""Let's go in. Do you mind? I'd rather like to pray a little for him or something."We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw she was looking straight ahead."Come on," she whispered throatily. "Let's get out of here. Makes me damned nervous."Outside in the hot brightness of the street Brett looked up at the tree-tops in the wind. The praying had not been much of a success."Don't know why I get so nervy in church," Brett said. "Never does me any good."We walked along."I'm damned bad for a religious atmosphere," Brett said. "I've the wrong type of face."You know," Brett said, "I'm not worried about him at all. I just feel happy about him.""Good.""I wish the wind would drop, though.""It's liable to go down by five o'clock.""Let's hope.""You might pray," I laughed."Never does me any good. I've never gotten anything I prayed for. Have you?""Oh, yes.""Oh, rot," said Brett. "Maybe it works for some people, though. You don't look very religious, Jake.""I'm pretty religious.""Oh, rot," said Brett. "Don't start proselyting to-day. To-day's going to be bad enough as it is."It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way since before she went off with Cohn. We were back again in front of the hotel. All the tables were set now, and already several were filled with people eating."Do look after Mike," Brett said. "Don't let him get too bad.""Your frients haff gone up-stairs," the German maître d'hôtel said in English. He was a continual eavesdropper. Brett turned to him:"Thank you, so much. Have you anything else to say?""No, ma'am.""Good," said Brett."Save us a table for three," I said to the German. He smiled his dirty little pink-and-white smile."Iss madam eating here?""No," Brett said."Den I think a tabul for two will be enuff.""Don't talk to him," Brett said. "Mike must have been in bad shape," she said on the stairs. We passed Montoya on the stairs. He bowed and did not smile."I'll see you at the café," Brett said. "Thank you, so much, Jake."We had stopped at the floor our rooms were on. She went straight down the hall and into Romero's room. She did not knock. She simply opened the door, went in, and closed it behind her.I stood in front of the door of Mike's room and knocked. There was no answer. I tried the knob and it opened. Inside the room was in great disorder. All the bags were opened and clothing was strewn around. There were empty bottles beside the bed. Mike lay on the bed looking like a death mask of himself. He opened his eyes and looked at me."Hello, Jake," he said very slowly. "I'm getting a lit tle sleep. I've want ed a lit tle sleep for a long time.""Let me cover you over.""No. I'm quite warm.""Don't go. I have n't got ten to sleep yet.""You'll sleep, Mike. Don't worry, boy.""Brett's got a bull-fighter," Mike said. "But her Jew has gone away."He turned his head and looked at me."Damned good thing, what?""Yes. Now go to sleep, Mike. You ought to get some sleep.""I'm just start ing. I'm go ing to get a lit tle sleep."He shut his eyes. I went out of the room and turned the door to quietly. Bill was in my room reading the paper."See Mike?""Yes.""Let's go and eat.""I won't eat down-stairs with that German head waiter. He was damned snotty when I was getting Mike up-stairs.""He was snotty to us, too.""Let's go out and eat in the town."We went down the stairs. On the stairs we passed a girl coming up with a covered tray."There goes Brett's lunch," Bill said."And the kid's," I said.Outside on the terrace under the arcade the German head waiter came up. His red cheeks were shiny. He was being polite."I haff a tabul for two for you gentlemen," he said."Go sit at it," Bill said. We went on out across the street.We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much. Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked in the room and that Mike was asleep.When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front, beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow. It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and firm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched it all. She was absorbed in the professional details."He's his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas," she said. "Why do they call them muletas?""I don't know.""I wonder if they ever launder them.""I don't think so. It might spoil the color.""The blood must stiffen them," Bill said."Funny," Brett said. "How one doesn't mind the blood."Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full. There was not an empty seat except in the President's box. When he came in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses."Here, would you like to look?"I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette guardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The music started. Brett looked through the glasses."Here, take them," she said.Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their hats on, before the President's box, and then came over to the barrera below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero's lips were puffed, both eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and handed up the cape."Spread it out in front of you," I said.Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold. The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man beside me leaned over toward Brett."He doesn't want you to spread it," he said. "You should fold it and keep it in your lap."Brett folded the heavy cape.Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it and Romero poured water over the percale of his fighting-cape, and then scuffed the lower folds in the sand with his slippered foot."What's that for?" Brett asked."To give it weight in the wind.""His face looks bad," Bill said."He feels very badly," Brett said. "He should be in bed."The first bull was Belmonte's. Belmonte was very good. But because he got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than very good. Belmonte's great attraction is working close to the bull. In bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy. People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls. When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been, and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded and cheated, and Belmonte's jaw came further out in contempt, and his face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults, and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables, thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs. His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms, not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back into the ring.Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him. Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by the false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully, what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon. Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him, and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.His first "quite" was directly below us. The three matadors take the bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head. He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught the bull's eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of muscle on the bull's shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull's shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The bull's tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero's cape filled again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep. He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going away.In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order him replaced."Why don't they change him?" Brett asked."They've paid for him. They don't want to lose their money.""It's hardly fair to Romero.""Watch how he handles a bull that can't see the color.""It's the sort of thing I don't like to see."It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and would start for it, and then shift the bull's charge to the flannel and finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not like it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull's charge from his own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte's imitation of himself or Marcial's imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row behind us."What's he afraid of the bull for? The bull's so dumb he only goes after the cloth.""He's just a young bull-fighter. He hasn't learned it yet.""But I thought he was fine with the cape before.""Probably he's nervous now."Out in the centre of the ring, all alone, Romero was going on with the same thing, getting so close that the bull could see him plainly, offering the body, offering it again a little closer, the bull watching dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came, giving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost imperceptible, jerk that so offended the critical judgment of the Biarritz bull-fight experts."He's going to kill now," I said to Brett. "The bull's still strong. He wouldn't wear himself out."Out in the centre of the ring Romero profiled in front of the bull, drew the sword out from the folds of the muleta, rose on his toes, and sighted along the blade. The bull charged as Romero charged. Romero's left hand dropped the muleta over the bull's muzzle to blind him, his left shoulder went forward between the horns as the sword went in, and for just an instant he and the bull were one, Romero way out over the bull, the right arm extended high up to where the hilt of the sword had gone in between the bull's shoulders. Then the figure was broken. There was a little jolt as Romero came clear, and then he was standing, one hand up, facing the bull, his shirt ripped out from under his sleeve, the white blowing in the wind, and the bull, the red sword hilt tight between his shoulders, his head going down and his legs settling."There he goes," Bill said.Romero was close enough so the bull could see him. His hand still up, he spoke to the bull. The bull gathered himself, then his head went forward and he went over slowly, then all over, suddenly, four feet in the air.They handed the sword to Romero, and carrying it blade down, the muleta in his other hand, he walked over to in front of the President's box, bowed, straightened, and came over to the barrera and handed over the sword and muleta."Bad one," said the sword-handler."He made me sweat," said Romero. He wiped off his face. The sword-handler handed him the water-jug. Romero wiped his lips. It hurt him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero's last bull came in. It was the bull that had sprinted out and killed the man in the morning running.During Romero's first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable. Everything he did showed it. All the concentration of the awkwardly delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out. The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged easily and surely. He was what Romero wanted in bulls.When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow, templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed directly below us. He killed not as he had been forced to by the last bull, but as he wanted to. He profiled directly in front of the bull, drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the blade. The bull watched him. Romero spoke to the bull and tapped one of his feet. The bull charged and Romero waited for the charge, the muleta held low, sighting along the blade, his feet firm. Then without taking a step forward, he became one with the bull, the sword was in high between the shoulders, the bull had followed the low-swung flannel, that disappeared as Romero lurched clear to the left, and it was over. The bull tried to go forward, his legs commenced to settle, he swung from side to side, hesitated, then went down on his knees, and Romero's older brother leaned forward behind him and drove a short knife into the bull's neck at the base of the horns. The first time he missed. He drove the knife in again, and the bull went over, twitching and rigid. Romero's brother, holding the bull's horn in one hand, the knife in the other, looked up at the President's box. Handkerchiefs were waving all over the bull-ring. The President looked down from the box and waved his handkerchief. The brother cut the notched black ear from the dead bull and trotted over with it to Romero. The bull lay heavy and black on the sand, his tongue out. Boys were running toward him from all parts of the arena, making a little circle around him. They were starting to dance around the bull.Romero took the ear from his brother and held it up toward the President. The President bowed and Romero, running to get ahead of the crowd, came toward us. He leaned up against the barrera and gave the ear to Brett. He nodded his head and smiled. The crowd were all about him. Brett held down the cape."You liked it?" Romero called.Brett did not say anything. They looked at each other and smiled. Brett had the ear in her hand."Don't get bloody," Romero said, and grinned. The crowd wanted him. Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them, toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people's shoulders. But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody's shoulder. He looked around at us apologetically. The crowd, running, went out the gate with him.We all three went back to the hotel. Brett went up-stairs. Bill and I sat in the down-stairs dining-room and ate some hard-boiled eggs and drank several bottles of beer. Belmonte came down in his street clothes with his manager and two other men. They sat at the next table and ate. Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o'clock train for Barcelona. Belmonte wore a blue-striped shirt and a dark suit, and ate soft-boiled eggs. The others ate a big meal. Belmonte did not talk. He only answered questions.Bill was tired after the bull-fight. So was I. We both took a bull-fight very hard. We sat and ate the eggs and I watched Belmonte and the people at his table. The men with him were tough-looking and businesslike."Come on over to the café," Bill said. "I want an absinthe."It was the last day of the fiesta. Outside it was beginning to be cloudy again. The square was full of people and the fireworks experts were making up their set pieces for the night and covering them over with beech branches. Boys were watching. We passed stands of rockets with long bamboo stems. Outside the café there was a great crowd. The music and the dancing were going on. The giants and the dwarfs were passing."Where's Edna?" I asked Bill."I don't know."We watched the beginning of the evening of the last night of the fiesta. The absinthe made everything seem better. I drank it without sugar in the dripping glass, and it was pleasantly bitter."I feel sorry about Cohn," Bill said. "He had an awful time.""Oh, to hell with Cohn," I said."Where do you suppose he went?""Up to Paris.""What do you suppose he'll do?""Oh, to hell with him.""What do you suppose he'll do?""Pick up with his old girl, probably.""Who was his old girl?""Somebody named Frances."We had another absinthe."When do you go back?" I asked."To-morrow."After a little while Bill said: "Well, it was a swell fiesta.""Yes," I said; "something doing all the time.""You wouldn't believe it. It's like a wonderful nightmare.""Sure," I said. "I'd believe anything. Including nightmares.""What's the matter? Feel low?""Low as hell.""Have another absinthe. Here, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor.""I feel like hell," I said."Drink that," said Bill. "Drink it slow."It was beginning to get dark. The fiesta was going on. I began to feel drunk but I did not feel any better."How do you feel?""I feel like hell.""Have another?""It won't do any good.""Try it. You can't tell; maybe this is the one that gets it. Hey, waiter! Another absinthe for this señor!"I poured the water directly into it and stirred it instead of letting it drip. Bill put in a lump of ice. I stirred the ice around with a spoon in the brownish, cloudy mixture."How is it?""Fine.""Don't drink it fast that way. It will make you sick."I set down the glass. I had not meant to drink it fast."I feel tight.""You ought to.""That's what you wanted, wasn't it?""Sure. Get tight. Get over your damn depression.""Well, I'm tight. Is that what you want?""Sit down.""I won't sit down," I said. "I'm going over to the hotel."I was very drunk. I was drunker than I ever remembered having been. At the hotel I went up-stairs. Brett's door was open. I put my head in the room. Mike was sitting on the bed. He waved a bottle."Jake," he said. "Come in, Jake."I went in and sat down. The room was unstable unless I looked at some fixed point."Brett, you know. She's gone off with the bull-fighter chap.""No.""Yes. She looked for you to say good-bye. They went on the seven o'clock train.""Did they?""Bad thing to do," Mike said. "She shouldn't have done it.""No.""Have a drink? Wait while I ring for some beer.""I'm drunk," I said. "I'm going in and lie down.""Are you blind? I was blind myself.""Yes," I said, "I'm blind.""Well, bung-o," Mike said. "Get some sleep, old Jake."I went out the door and into my own room and lay on the bed. The bed went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with them. I pretended to be asleep."He's asleep. Better let him alone.""He's blind as a tick," Mike said. They went out.I got up and went to the balcony and looked out at the dancing in the square. The world was not wheeling any more. It was just very clear and bright, and inclined to blur at the edges. I washed, brushed my hair. I looked strange to myself in the glass, and went down-stairs to the dining-room."Here he is!" said Bill. "Good old Jake! I knew you wouldn't pass out.""Hello, you old drunk," Mike said."I got hungry and woke up.""Eat some soup," Bill said.The three of us sat at the table, and it seemed as though about six people were missing.In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about nine o'clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was empty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were picking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafés were just opening and the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the arcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The waiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were still up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing away the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come walking across the square. He sat down at the table and ordered a coffee."Well," he said, "it's all over.""Yes," I said. "When do you go?""I don't know. We better get a car, I think. Aren't you going back to Paris?""No. I can stay away another week. I think I'll go to San Sebastian.""I want to get back.""What's Mike going to do?""He's going to Saint Jean de Luz.""Let's get a car and all go as far as Bayonne. You can get the train up from there to-night.""Good. Let's go after lunch.""All right. I'll get the car."We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the maids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the front seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from Pamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet, green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill's baggage at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at seven-ten. We came out of the station. The car was standing out in front."What shall we do about the car?" Bill asked."Oh, bother the car," Mike said. "Let's just keep the car with us.""All right," Bill said. "Where shall we go?""Let's go to Biarritz and have a drink.""Old Mike the spender," Bill said.We drove in to Biarritz and left the car outside a very Ritz place. We went into the bar and sat on high stools and drank a whiskey and soda."That drink's mine," Mike said."Let's roll for it."So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out first roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc note. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar. We had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill and Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the second. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there were three kings, an ace, and a queen."It's yours, Mike," Bill said. "Old Mike, the gambler.""I'm so sorry," Mike said. "I can't get it.""What's the matter?""I've no money," Mike said. "I'm stony. I've just twenty francs. Here, take twenty francs."Bill's face sort of changed."I just had enough to pay Montoya. Damned lucky to have it, too.""I'll cash you a check," Bill said."That's damned nice of you, but you see I can't write checks.""What are you going to do for money?""Oh, some will come through. I've two weeks allowance should be here. I can live on tick at this pub in Saint Jean.""What do you want to do about the car?" Bill asked me. "Do you want to keep it on?""It doesn't make any difference. Seems sort of idiotic.""Come on, let's have another drink," Mike said."Fine. This one is on me," Bill said. "Has Brett any money?" He turned to Mike."I shouldn't think so. She put up most of what I gave to old Montoya.""She hasn't any money with her?" I asked."I shouldn't think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.""I suppose they get it at the source," said Bill."Quite. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They're Scotsmen, I believe.""Hasn't she any at all with her?" I asked."I hardly think so. She gave it all to me when she left.""Well," Bill said, "we might as well have another drink.""Damned good idea," Mike said. "One never gets anywhere by discussing finances.""No," said Bill. Bill and I rolled for the next two rounds. Bill lost and paid. We went out to the car."Anywhere you'd like to go, Mike?" Bill asked."Let's take a drive. It might do my credit good. Let's drive about a little.""Fine. I'd like to see the coast. Let's drive down toward Hendaye.""I haven't any credit along the coast.""You can't ever tell," said Bill.We drove out along the coast road. There was the green of the headlands, the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch of meadow, then the sea.At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the car and he got out. The chauffeur carried in his bags. Mike stood by the side of the car."Good-bye, you chaps," Mike said. "It was a damned fine fiesta.""So long, Mike," Bill said."I'll see you around," I said."Don't worry about money," Mike said. "You can pay for the car, Jake, and I'll send you my share.""So long, Mike.""So long, you chaps. You've been damned nice."We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried Bill's bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the tracks."So long, fella," Bill said."So long, kid!""It was swell. I've had a swell time.""Will you be in Paris?""No, I have to sail on the 17th. So long, fella!""So long, old kid!"He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the bags. I watched the train pull out. Bill was at one of the windows. The window passed, the rest of the train passed, and the tracks were empty. I went outside to the car."How much do we owe you?" I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas."Two hundred pesetas.""How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way back?""Fifty pesetas.""Don't kid me.""Thirty-five pesetas.""It's not worth it," I said. "Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri."At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in the town.At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York Herald and sat in a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill, except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit in the Marinas and listen."How does one eat inside?" I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a restaurant."Well. Very well. One eats very well.""Good."I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for company. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil and smelled like Italian strega. I told him to take the flowers of the Pyrenees away and bring me a vieux marc. The marc was good. I had a second marc after the coffee.The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees, so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason. If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis. I was back in France.Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be loyal.At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport, opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate, climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was at San Sebastian.Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond the roofs.I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in the bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an hour by coming to San Sebastian.As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police bulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms, and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all mail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six days. Then I went in and had lunch.After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the Concha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm, and the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the beach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the chill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot planks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay face downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming down to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark. The raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas. There was an orchestra playing inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved ice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers. They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them. The next morning at five o'clock the race resumed with the last lap, San Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The money could be arranged.The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack of boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders joked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork."Listen," he said, "to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze."One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said. Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and more sportif every year. It would be the most sportif country in the world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew France. La France Sportive. He knew road-racing. We had a cognac. After all, though, it wasn't bad to get back to Paris. There is only one Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most sportif in the world. Did I know the Chope de Negre? Did I not. I would see him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another fine together. We certainly would. They started at six o'clock less a quarter in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to. Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until the next morning.In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars had been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and in peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish children were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree talking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach and went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers, but having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and floated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the swells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have a wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I turned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt as though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat, dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered names. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill with a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high headland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid of cramp.I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and swam slowly and steadily in to shore.After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of L'Auto around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a blue envelope in his hand."A telegram for you, sir."I poked my finger along under the fold that was fastened down, spread it open, and read it. It had been forwarded from Paris:I tipped the concierge and read the message again. A postman was coming along the sidewalk. He turned in the hotel. He had a big moustache and looked very military. He came out of the hotel again. The concierge was just behind him."Here's another telegram for you, sir.""Thank you," I said.I opened it. It was forwarded from Pamplona.The concierge stood there waiting for another tip, probably."What time is there a train for Madrid?""It left at nine this morning. There is a slow train at eleven, and the Sud Express at ten to-night.""Get me a berth on the Sud Express. Do you want the money now?""Just as you wish," he said. "I will have it put on the bill.""Do that."Well, that meant San Sebastian all shot to hell. I suppose, vaguely, I had expected something of the sort. I saw the concierge standing in the doorway."Bring me a telegram form, please."He brought it and I took out my fountain-pen and printed:That seemed to handle it. That was it. Send a girl off with one man. Introduce her to another to go off with him. Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love. That was it all right. I went in to lunch.I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish there. They don't go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line of hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high, hot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San Jeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped at the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could not make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door."Is Lady Ashley here?" I asked.She looked at me dully."Is an Englishwoman here?"She turned and called some one inside. A very fat woman came to the door. Her hair was gray and stiffly oiled in scallops around her face. She was short and commanding."Muy buenos," I said. "Is there an Englishwoman here? I would like to see this English lady.""Muy buenos. Yes, there is a female English. Certainly you can see her if she wishes to see you.""She wishes to see me.""The chica will ask her.""It is very hot.""It is very hot in the summer in Madrid.""And how cold in winter.""Yes, it is very cold in winter."Did I want to stay myself in person in the Hotel Montana?Of that as yet I was undecided, but it would give me pleasure if my bags were brought up from the ground floor in order that they might not be stolen. Nothing was ever stolen in the Hotel Montana. In other fondas, yes. Not here. No. The personages of this establishment were rigidly selectioned. I was happy to hear it. Nevertheless I would welcome the upbringal of my bags.The maid came in and said that the female English wanted to see the male English now, at once."Good," I said. "You see. It is as I said.""Clearly."I followed the maid's back down a long, dark corridor. At the end she knocked on a door."Hello," said Brett. "Is it you, Jake?""It's me.""Come in. Come in."I opened the door. The maid closed it after me. Brett was in bed. She had just been brushing her hair and held the brush in her hand. The room was in that disorder produced only by those who have always had servants."Darling!" Brett said.I went over to the bed and put my arms around her. She kissed me, and while she kissed me I could feel she was thinking of something else. She was trembling in my arms. She felt very small."Darling! I've had such a hell of a time.""Tell me about it.""Nothing to tell. He only left yesterday. I made him go.""Why didn't you keep him?""I don't know. It isn't the sort of thing one does. I don't think I hurt him any.""You were probably damn good for him.""He shouldn't be living with any one. I realized that right away.""No.""Oh, hell!" she said, "let's not talk about it. Let's never talk about it.""All right.""It was rather a knock his being ashamed of me. He was ashamed of me for a while, you know.""No.""Oh, yes. They ragged him about me at the café, I guess. He wanted me to grow my hair out. Me, with long hair. I'd look so like hell.""It's funny.""He said it would make me more womanly. I'd look a fright.""What happened?""Oh, he got over that. He wasn't ashamed of me long.""What was it about being in trouble?""I didn't know whether I could make him go, and I didn't have a sou to go away and leave him. He tried to give me a lot of money, you know. I told him I had scads of it. He knew that was a lie. I couldn't take his money, you know.""No.""Oh, let's not talk about it. There were some funny things, though. Do give me a cigarette."I lit the cigarette."He learned his English as a waiter in Gib.""Yes.""He wanted to marry me, finally.""Really?""Of course. I can't even marry Mike.""Maybe he thought that would make him Lord Ashley.""No. It wasn't that. He really wanted to marry me. So I couldn't go away from him, he said. He wanted to make it sure I could never go away from him. After I'd gotten more womanly, of course.""You ought to feel set up.""I do. I'm all right again. He's wiped out that damned Cohn.""Good.""You know I'd have lived with him if I hadn't seen it was bad for him. We got along damned well.""Outside of your personal appearance.""Oh, he'd have gotten used to that."She put out the cigarette."I'm thirty-four, you know. I'm not going to be one of these bitches that ruins children.""No.""I'm not going to be that way. I feel rather good, you know. I feel rather set up.""Good."She looked away. I thought she was looking for another cigarette. Then I saw she was crying. I could feel her crying. Shaking and crying. She wouldn't look up. I put my arms around her."Don't let's ever talk about it. Please don't let's ever talk about it.""Dear Brett.""I'm going back to Mike." I could feel her crying as I held her close. "He's so damned nice and he's so awful. He's my sort of thing."She would not look up. I stroked her hair. I could feel her shaking."I won't be one of those bitches," she said. "But, oh, Jake, please let's never talk about it."We left the Hotel Montana. The woman who ran the hotel would not let me pay the bill. The bill had been paid."Oh, well. Let it go," Brett said. "It doesn't matter now."We rode in a taxi down to the Palace Hotel, left the bags, arranged for berths on the Sud Express for the night, and went into the bar of the hotel for a cocktail. We sat on high stools at the bar while the barman shook the Martinis in a large nickelled shaker."It's funny what a wonderful gentility you get in the bar of a big hotel," I said."Barmen and jockeys are the only people who are polite any more.""No matter how vulgar a hotel is, the bar is always nice.""It's odd.""Bartenders have always been fine.""You know," Brett said, "it's quite true. He is only nineteen. Isn't it amazing?"We touched the two glasses as they stood side by side on the bar. They were coldly beaded. Outside the curtained window was the summer heat of Madrid."I like an olive in a Martini," I said to the barman."Right you are, sir. There you are.""Thanks.""I should have asked, you know."The barman went far enough up the bar so that he would not hear our conversation. Brett had sipped from the Martini as it stood, on the wood. Then she picked it up. Her hand was steady enough to lift it after that first sip."It's good. Isn't it a nice bar?""They're all nice bars.""You know I didn't believe it at first. He was born in 1905. I was in school in Paris, then. Think of that.""Anything you want me to think about it?""Don't be an ass. Would you buy a lady a drink?""We'll have two more Martinis.""As they were before, sir?""They were very good." Brett smiled at him."Thank you, ma'am.""Well, bung-o," Brett said."Bung-o!""You know," Brett said, "he'd only been with two women before. He never cared about anything but bull-fighting.""He's got plenty of time.""I don't know. He thinks it was me. Not the show in general.""Well, it was you.""Yes. It was me.""I thought you weren't going to ever talk about it.""How can I help it?""You'll lose it if you talk about it.""I just talk around it. You know I feel rather damned good, Jake.""You should.""You know it makes one feel rather good deciding not to be a bitch.""Yes.""It's sort of what we have instead of God.""Some people have God," I said. "Quite a lot.""He never worked very well with me.""Should we have another Martini?"The barman shook up two more Martinis and poured them out into fresh glasses."Where will we have lunch?" I asked Brett. The bar was cool. You could feel the heat outside through the window."Here?" asked Brett."It's rotten here in the hotel. Do you know a place called Botin's?" I asked the barman."Yes, sir. Would you like to have me write out the address?""Thank you."We lunched up-stairs at Botin's. It is one of the best restaurants in the world. We had roast young suckling pig and drank rioja alta. Brett did not eat much. She never ate much. I ate a very big meal and drank three bottles of rioja alta."How do you feel, Jake?" Brett asked. "My God! what a meal you've eaten.""I feel fine. Do you want a dessert?""Lord, no."Brett was smoking."You like to eat, don't you?" she said."Yes." I said. "I like to do a lot of things.""What do you like to do?""Oh," I said, "I like to do a lot of things. Don't you want a dessert?""You asked me that once," Brett said."Yes," I said. "So I did. Let's have another bottle of rioja alta.""It's very good.""You haven't drunk much of it," I said."I have. You haven't seen.""Let's get two bottles," I said. The bottles came. I poured a little in my glass, then a glass for Brett, then filled my glass. We touched glasses."Bung-o!" Brett said. I drank my glass and poured out another. Brett put her hand on my arm."Don't get drunk, Jake," she said. "You don't have to.""How do you know?""Don't," she said. "You'll be all right.""I'm not getting drunk," I said. "I'm just drinking a little wine. I like to drink wine.""Don't get drunk," she said. "Jake, don't get drunk.""Want to go for a ride?" I said. "Want to ride through the town?""Right," Brett said. "I haven't seen Madrid. I should see Madrid.""I'll finish this," I said.Down-stairs we came out through the first-floor dining-room to the street. A waiter went for a taxi. It was hot and bright. Up the street was a little square with trees and grass where there were taxis parked. A taxi came up the street, the waiter hanging out at the side. I tipped him and told the driver where to drive, and got in beside Brett. The driver started up the street. I settled back. Brett moved close to me. We sat close against each other. I put my arm around her and she rested against me comfortably. It was very hot and bright, and the houses looked sharply white. We turned out onto the Gran Via."Oh, Jake," Brett said, "we could have had such a damned good time together."Ahead was a mounted policeman in khaki directing traffic. He raised his baton. The car slowed suddenly pressing Brett against me."Yes," I said. "Isn't it pretty to think so?"
FOR EZRA POUND IL MIGLIOR FABBRO  I. The Burial of the Dead  April is the cruellest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with spring rain. Winter kept us warm, covering Earth in forgetful snow, feeding A little life with dried tubers. Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade, And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, And drank coffee, and talked for an hour. Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch. And when we were children, staying at the arch-duke's, My cousin's, he took me out on a sled, And I was frightened. He said, Marie, Marie, hold on tight. And down we went. In the mountains, there you feel free. I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.  What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow Out of this stony rubbish? Son of man, You cannot say, or guess, for you know only A heap of broken images, where the sun beats, And the dead tree gives no shelter, the cricket no relief, And the dry stone no sound of water. Only There is shadow under this red rock, (Come in under the shadow of this red rock), And I will show you something different from either Your shadow at morning striding behind you Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you; I will show you fear in a handful of dust. Frisch weht der Wind Der Heimat zu Mein Irisch Kind, Wo weilest du? "You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; "They called me the hyacinth girl." —Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, Looking into the heart of light, the silence. Oed' und leer das Meer.  Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante, Had a bad cold, nevertheless Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe, With a wicked pack of cards. Here, said she, Is your card, the drowned Phoenician Sailor, (Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!) Here is Belladonna, the Lady of the Rocks, The lady of situations. Here is the man with three staves, and here the Wheel, And here is the one-eyed merchant, and this card, Which is blank, is something he carries on his back, Which I am forbidden to see. I do not find The Hanged Man. Fear death by water. I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring. Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone, Tell her I bring the horoscope myself: One must be so careful these days.  Unreal City, Under the brown fog of a winter dawn, A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many, I had not thought death had undone so many. Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled, And each man fixed his eyes before his feet. Flowed up the hill and down King William Street, To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hours With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine. There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: "Stetson! "You who were with me in the ships at Mylae! "That corpse you planted last year in your garden, "Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year? "Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed? "Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's friend to men, "Or with his nails he'll dig it up again! "You! hypocrite lecteur!—mon semblable,—mon frère!"   II. A Game of Chess  The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, Glowed on the marble, where the glass Held up by standards wrought with fruited vines From which a golden Cupidon peeped out (Another hid his eyes behind his wing) Doubled the flames of sevenbranched candelabra Reflecting light upon the table as The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it, From satin cases poured in rich profusion; In vials of ivory and coloured glass Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes, Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air That freshened from the window, these ascended In fattening the prolonged candle-flames, Flung their smoke into the laquearia, Stirring the pattern on the coffered ceiling. Huge sea-wood fed with copper Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone, In which sad light a carvéd dolphin swam. Above the antique mantel was displayed As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale Filled all the desert with inviolable voice And still she cried, and still the world pursues, "Jug Jug" to dirty ears. And other withered stumps of time Were told upon the walls; staring forms Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed. Footsteps shuffled on the stair. Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair Spread out in fiery points Glowed into words, then would be savagely still.  "My nerves are bad tonight. Yes, bad. Stay with me. "Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak. "What are you thinking of? What thinking? What? "I never know what you are thinking. Think."  I think we are in rats' alley Where the dead men lost their bones.  "What is that noise?" The wind under the door. "What is that noise now? What is the wind doing?" Nothing again nothing.                       "Do "You know nothing? Do you see nothing? Do you remember "Nothing?"  I remember Those are pearls that were his eyes. "Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head?"                                           But O O O O that Shakespeherian Rag— It's so elegant So intelligent "What shall I do now? What shall I do?" "I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street "With my hair down, so. What shall we do tomorrow? "What shall we ever do?"              The hot water at ten. And if it rains, a closed car at four. And we shall play a game of chess, Pressing lidless eyes and waiting for a knock upon the door.  When Lil's husband got demobbed, I said— I didn't mince my words, I said to her myself, HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart. He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there. You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set, He said, I swear, I can't bear to look at you. And no more can't I, I said, and think of poor Albert, He's been in the army four years, he wants a good time, And if you don't give it him, there's others will, I said. Oh is there, she said. Something o' that, I said. Then I'll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look. HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME If you don't like it you can get on with it, I said. Others can pick and choose if you can't. But if Albert makes off, it won't be for lack of telling. You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique. (And her only thirty-one.) I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face, It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said. (She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.) The chemist said it would be all right, but I've never been the same. You are a proper fool, I said. Well, if Albert won't leave you alone, there it is, I said, What you get married for if you don't want children? HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon, And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot— HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME Goonight Bill. Goonight Lou. Goonight May. Goonight. Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight. Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.   III. The Fire Sermon  The river's tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed. Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song. The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers, Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed. And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors; Departed, have left no addresses. By the waters of Leman I sat down and wept . . . Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song, Sweet Thames, run softly, for I speak not loud or long. But at my back in a cold blast I hear The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.  A rat crept softly through the vegetation Dragging its slimy belly on the bank While I was fishing in the dull canal On a winter evening round behind the gashouse Musing upon the king my brother's wreck And on the king my father's death before him. White bodies naked on the low damp ground And bones cast in a little low dry garret, Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year. But at my back from time to time I hear The sound of horns and motors, which shall bring Sweeney to Mrs. Porter in the spring. O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter And on her daughter They wash their feet in soda water Et O ces voix d'enfants, chantant dans la coupole!  Twit twit twit Jug jug jug jug jug jug So rudely forc'd. Tereu  Unreal City Under the brown fog of a winter noon Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant Unshaven, with a pocket full of currants C.i.f. London: documents at sight, Asked me in demotic French To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.  At the violet hour, when the eyes and back Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits Like a taxi throbbing waiting, I Tiresias, though blind, throbbing between two lives, Old man with wrinkled female breasts, can see At the violet hour, the evening hour that strives Homeward, and brings the sailor home from sea, The typist home at teatime, clears her breakfast, lights Her stove, and lays out food in tins. Out of the window perilously spread Her drying combinations touched by the sun's last rays, On the divan are piled (at night her bed) Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays. I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs Perceived the scene, and foretold the rest— I too awaited the expected guest. He, the young man carbuncular, arrives, A small house agent's clerk, with one bold stare, One of the low on whom assurance sits As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire. The time is now propitious, as he guesses, The meal is ended, she is bored and tired, Endeavours to engage her in caresses Which still are unreproved, if undesired. Flushed and decided, he assaults at once; Exploring hands encounter no defence; His vanity requires no response, And makes a welcome of indifference. (And I Tiresias have foresuffered all Enacted on this same divan or bed; I who have sat by Thebes below the wall And walked among the lowest of the dead.) Bestows one final patronising kiss, And gropes his way, finding the stairs unlit . . .  She turns and looks a moment in the glass, Hardly aware of her departed lover; Her brain allows one half-formed thought to pass: "Well now that's done: and I'm glad it's over." When lovely woman stoops to folly and Paces about her room again, alone, She smoothes her hair with automatic hand, And puts a record on the gramophone.  "This music crept by me upon the waters" And along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street. O City city, I can sometimes hear Beside a public bar in Lower Thames Street, The pleasant whining of a mandoline And a clatter and a chatter from within Where fishmen lounge at noon: where the walls Of Magnus Martyr hold Inexplicable splendour of Ionian white and gold.  The river sweats Oil and tar The barges drift With the turning tide Red sails Wide To leeward, swing on the heavy spar. The barges wash Drifting logs Down Greenwich reach Past the Isle of Dogs. Weialala leia Wallala leialala  Elizabeth and Leicester Beating oars The stern was formed A gilded shell Red and gold The brisk swell Rippled both shores Southwest wind Carried down stream The peal of bells White towers Weialala leia Wallala leialala  "Trams and dusty trees.

He promised a ‘new start.' I made no comment. What should I resent?"  "On Margate Sands. I can connect Nothing with nothing. The broken fingernails of dirty hands. My people humble people who expect Nothing." la la  To Carthage then I came  Burning burning burning burning O Lord Thou pluckest me out O Lord Thou pluckest  burning   IV. Death by Water  Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead, Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell And the profit and loss.  A current under sea Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell He passed the stages of his age and youth Entering the whirlpool.  Gentile or Jew O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.   V. What the Thunder Said  After the torchlight red on sweaty faces After the frosty silence in the gardens After the agony in stony places The shouting and the crying Prison and palace and reverberation Of thunder of spring over distant mountains He who was living is now dead We who were living are now dying With a little patience  Here is no water but only rock Rock and no water and the sandy road The road winding above among the mountains Which are mountains of rock without water If there were water we should stop and drink Amongst the rock one cannot stop or think Sweat is dry and feet are in the sand If there were only water amongst the rock Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit Here one can neither stand nor lie nor sit There is not even silence in the mountains But dry sterile thunder without rain There is not even solitude in the mountains But red sullen faces sneer and snarl From doors of mudcracked houses     If there were water And no rock If there were rock And also water And water A spring A pool among the rock If there were the sound of water only Not the cicada And dry grass singing But sound of water over a rock Where the hermit-thrush sings in the pine trees Drip drop drip drop drop drop drop But there is no water  Who is the third who walks always beside you? When I count, there are only you and I together But when I look ahead up the white road There is always another one walking beside you Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded I do not know whether a man or a woman —But who is that on the other side of you?  What is that sound high in the air Murmur of maternal lamentation Who are those hooded hordes swarming Over endless plains, stumbling in cracked earth Ringed by the flat horizon only What is the city over the mountains Cracks and reforms and bursts in the violet air Falling towers Jerusalem Athens Alexandria Vienna London Unreal  A woman drew her long black hair out tight And fiddled whisper music on those strings And bats with baby faces in the violet light Whistled, and beat their wings And crawled head downward down a blackened wall And upside down in air were towers Tolling reminiscent bells, that kept the hours And voices singing out of empty cisterns and exhausted wells.  In this decayed hole among the mountains In the faint moonlight, the grass is singing Over the tumbled graves, about the chapel There is the empty chapel, only the wind's home. It has no windows, and the door swings, Dry bones can harm no one. Only a cock stood on the rooftree Co co rico co co rico In a flash of lightning. Then a damp gust Bringing rain  Ganga was sunken, and the limp leaves Waited for rain, while the black clouds Gathered far distant, over Himavant. The jungle crouched, humped in silence. Then spoke the thunder DA Datta: what have we given? My friend, blood shaking my heart The awful daring of a moment's surrender Which an age of prudence can never retract By this, and this only, we have existed Which is not to be found in our obituaries Or in memories draped by the beneficent spider Or under seals broken by the lean solicitor In our empty rooms DA Dayadhvam: I have heard the key Turn in the door once and turn once only We think of the key, each in his prison Thinking of the key, each confirms a prison Only at nightfall, aethereal rumours Revive for a moment a broken Coriolanus DA Damyata: The boat responded Gaily, to the hand expert with sail and oar The sea was calm, your heart would have responded Gaily, when invited, beating obedient To controlling hands    I sat upon the shore Fishing, with the arid plain behind me Shall I at least set my lands in order? London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina Quando fiam uti chelidon—O swallow swallow Le Prince d'Aquitaine à la tour abolie These fragments I have shored against my ruins Why then Ile fit you. Hieronymo's mad againe. Datta. Dayadhvam. Damyata. Shantih     shantih     shantih
